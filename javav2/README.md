# AWS SDK for Java (v2) code examples

To build and run these AWS SDK for Java (v2) code examples, you need the following:

- Local access to [this repository](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples) by cloning, forking, or downloading a zip file.
- An installation of [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) (>3.0)
- **All Java (v2) examples assume that the Java SDK can obtain AWS credentials using its default credentials provider chain**. 
  - You can set up the [default profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/file-format.html#file-format-profile) in the shared AWS configuration files:
    - with [IAM Identity Center SSO](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/credentials-temporary.html#credentials-temporary-idc) settings in `~/.aws/config`
    - [temporary credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/credentials-temporary.html#credentials-temporary-from-portal) in `~/.aws/credentials`
- Default Region configuration. You can set this in your default profile along with settings for access to AWS credentials. If a Region is not set, the default Region used is **us-east-1**.

**Note**: For more information about configuring access to your AWS credentials, see [Supplying and retrieving AWS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/credentials.html).

## AWS SDK for Java

The **javav2** folder in this repository contains examples of complete use cases, and AWS service-based code examples.

Each use case example and service-based code example directory includes an Apache Maven `pom.xml` file with dependency and configuration settings for that example.

### Use cases

In the **usecases** folder, find step-by-step development tutorials that use multiple AWS services. By following these tutorials, you will gain a deeper understanding of how to create Java-based applications that use the AWS SDK for Java. Most of these AWS SDK for Java tutorials use synchronous Java clients.

### AWS service examples

The AWS service-specific Java examples are located in the **example_code** folder. The examples are divided into directories by AWS service (**s3**, **sqs**, and so on). Within each, you'll find a **pom.xml** file used for building the examples with Maven.

## Build and run the service examples

### Build the examples using Apache Maven or Gradle

To run these examples, you can setup your development environment to use Apache Maven or Gradle to configure and build AWS SDK for Java projects. For more information,  
see "Get started with the AWS SDK for Java 2.x" located at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/get-started.html.

**Note:** Add the POM file you find in a service-specific folder to the POM file in the project. Then create a package that you find in the examples and you can start adding the Java classes to your project.

### Build the examples from the command line

To build any of the service examples, open a command-prompt (terminal) window and change to the directory containing the examples
you want to build or run. Then type::

mvn package

You can use the Apache Maven Shade Plugin to package your JAR file with the artifacts in an uber JAR, which consists of all dependencies required to run the project. Ensure that the POM file has the required plugin to build the JAR with the dependencies.

    <plugin>
       <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>

       <artifactId>maven-shade-plugin</artifactId>

       <version>3.0.0</version>

       <executions>

       <execution>

       <phase>package</phase>

       <goals>

       <goal>shade</goal>

       </goals>

       </execution>

       </executions>

       </plugin>

For example, if you execute this command from the **s3** directory, you will find a JAR file named **S3J2Project-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar** in the **target** folder.

Or, if you have **make**, you can begin the build process by typing::

make

Maven will download any dependencies (such as components of the AWS SDK
for Java) that it needs for building.

Once the examples are built, you can run them to see them in action.

.. note:: If you are running on a platform with **make**, you can also use the provided Makefiles to
build the examples, by running **make** in any directory with a **Makefile** present. You must
still have Maven installed, however (the Makefile wraps Maven commands).

### Run the service examples

**IMPORTANT**

The examples perform AWS operations for the account and AWS Region for which you've specified
credentials, and you may incur AWS service charges by running them. See the `AWS Pricing
   <https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/>`\_ page for details about the charges you can expect for a given
service and operation.

Some of these examples perform _destructive_ operations on AWS resources, such as deleting an
Amazon S3 bucket or an Amazon DynamoDB table. **Be very careful** when running an operation that
may delete or modify AWS resources in your account. It's best to create separate test-only
resources when experimenting with these examples.

Because you built the JAR file that contains the dependencies, you can run an example using the following command. For example, you can run an S3 Java V2 example using this command:

          java -cp target/S3J2Project-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.s3.ListObjects mybucket

### Tests

You can test the Java code examples for a given AWS service by running a test file located in this GitHub repository. The test file uses JUnit 5 to run the JUnit tests. It's located in the **src/test/java** folder. For more information, see https://junit.org/junit5/.

You can run the JUnit tests from a Java IDE, such as IntelliJ, or from the command line by using Maven. As each test runs, you can view messages that inform you if the various tests succeed or fail. For example, the following message informs you that Test 3 passed.

To run the JUnit tests from the command line, you can use the following command.

    	mvn test

You will see output from the JUnit tests, with an example shown here.

    [INFO] -------------------------------------------------------
    [INFO]  T E S T S

    [INFO] --------------------------------------------

WARNING: Running these JUnit tests manipulates real Amazon resources and might incur charges on your account.

#### Properties file

Before running the JUnit tests, you must define required values in the **config.properties** file that's located in the **resources** folder. To learn what the values represent, you can refer to the Java code examples. For example, if you are running Amazon S3 tests, look in the various Amazon S3 code example Java files for an explanation of the values.

### Docker image (Beta)

This example code will soon be available in a container image
hosted on [Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/what-is-ecr.html). This image will be pre-loaded
with all Java v2 examples with dependencies pre-resolved, allowing you to explore
these examples in an isolated environment.

⚠️ As of January 2023, the [SDK for Java v2 image](https://gallery.ecr.aws/b4v4v1s0/javav2) is available on ECR Public but is still
undergoing active development. Refer to
[this GitHub issue](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/issues/4128)
for more information.
