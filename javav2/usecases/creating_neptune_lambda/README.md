This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough for creating and deploying an AWS Lambda function that queries an Amazon Neptune graph database using the Neptune Data API.

Amazon Neptune is a fully managed graph database service designed to operate within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Because of this, any Lambda function that needs to access Neptune must also run inside the same VPC and be granted appropriate network and IAM permissions—external access is not supported.

To ensure secure and reliable communication between Lambda and Neptune, you’ll configure key AWS infrastructure components, including VPC subnets, security groups, and IAM roles. This guide covers all necessary setup and configuration tasks to help you successfully connect your Lambda function to Neptune using the Neptune Data API.

**Note**: Lambda is a compute service that you can use to run code without provisioning or managing servers. You can create Lambda functions in various programming languages. For more information about Lambda, see
[What is AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html).

+ A security group that allows traffic from Lambda to Neptune (typically on port 8182).
+ An AWS account with proper credentials.
+ AWS CLI configured with permissions for Lambda, IAM, EC2 (VPC), S3, Neptune. For information about setting up AWS CLI, see [Setting up the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-quickstart.html)
+ A Java IDE. (For this tutorial, the IntelliJ IDE is used.)
+ Java 21 JDK.
+ Maven 3.6 or higher.

### Important

+ The AWS services included in this document are included in the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc).
+  This code has not been tested in all AWS Regions. Some AWS services are available only in specific Regions. For more information, see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services). 
+ Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account. 
+ Be sure to delete all of the resources that you create during this tutorial so that you won't be charged.

## Set Up the Amazon Neptune Cluster and VPC

Amazon Neptune requires a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) with at least two subnets in different Availability Zones (AZs) to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

If you're unsure which VPC or subnets to use, you can easily generate the required resources by running the Amazon Neptune Basics scenario from the AWS Code Library. This setup will provision:

 - A suitable VPC with subnets in multiple AZs

 - A Neptune DB cluster and instance

 - All necessary networking and security configurations

This is a quick way to get a working Neptune environment that you can immediately use for this use case.

### Add data to the database

Once your Amazon Neptune cluster and database are set up, the next step is to load data into it. This data will be accessed by the AWS Lambda function created as part of this guide.

Amazon Neptune supports multiple data loading methods, including bulk loading from Amazon S3, Gremlin and SPARQL queries, and integration with AWS Database Migration Service.

To efficiently populate your Neptune database, use the Neptune bulk loader, which imports data stored in Amazon S3 using formats such as CSV, RDF, or Turtle.
For information on how to add data to the Amazon Neptune database, see [Loading Data into a Neptune DB Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/latest/userguide/bulk-load-data.html).

## Create the Lambda Execution IAM Role

### Create trust policy JSON file

You need to create the trust polciy used for this IAM role. Name the file **trust-policy-lambda.json**.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": { "Service": "lambda.amazonaws.com" },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}

```

### Create the lambda-execution-role role

You can create the **lambda-execution-role** role by using this CLI command.

```bash
aws iam create-role \
  --role-name lambda-execution-role \
  --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy-lambda.json
```
### Attach the required managed policies

Run each of the following AWS CLI commands to attach the necessary managed policies to the Lambda execution role: 

```bash
aws iam attach-role-policy \
  --role-name lambda-execution-role \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess

aws iam attach-role-policy \
  --role-name lambda-execution-role \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSNeptuneFullAccess

aws iam attach-role-policy \
  --role-name lambda-execution-role \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole

aws iam attach-role-policy \
  --role-name lambda-execution-role \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/CloudWatchLogsFullAccess

```


## Create an IntelliJ project

1. In the IntelliJ IDE, choose **File**, **New**, **Project**.

2. In the **New Project** dialog box, choose **Maven**, and then choose **Next**.

3. For **GroupId**, enter **org.example**.

4. For **ArtifactId**, enter **NeptuneLambda**.

5. Choose **Next**.

6. Choose **Finish**.

## Add the POM dependencies to your project

At this point, you have a new project named **NeptuneLambda**. Make sure that your project's **pom.xml** file looks like the POM file in this Github repository.
    
## Create a Lambda function by using the Lambda runtime Java API

Use the Lambda runtime Java API to create the Java class that defines the Lamdba function. In this example, there is one Java class for the Lambda function named **NeptuneLambdaHandler**. 


### NeptuneLambdaHandler class

This Java code represents the **NeptuneLambdaHandler** class. The class use the Neptune Data Client API to query data from the Neptune graph database.

```java
package org.example;

import com.amazonaws.services.lambda.runtime.Context;
import com.amazonaws.services.lambda.runtime.LambdaLogger;
import com.amazonaws.services.lambda.runtime.RequestHandler;
import software.amazon.awssdk.core.client.config.ClientOverrideConfiguration;
import software.amazon.awssdk.http.apache.ApacheHttpClient;
import software.amazon.awssdk.regions.Region;
import software.amazon.awssdk.services.neptunedata.NeptunedataClient;
import software.amazon.awssdk.services.neptunedata.model.ExecuteGremlinQueryRequest;
import software.amazon.awssdk.services.neptunedata.model.ExecuteGremlinQueryResponse;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;
import java.net.URI;
import java.time.Duration;
import java.util.Map;

public class NeptuneLambdaHandler implements RequestHandler<Map<String, String>, String> {

    @Override
    public String handleRequest(Map<String, String> event, Context context) {
        LambdaLogger logger = context.getLogger();

        String NEPTUNE_ENDPOINT = "<Specify your Endpoint>:8182";

        NeptunedataClient neptunedataClient = NeptunedataClient.builder()
                .region(Region.US_EAST_1)
                .endpointOverride(URI.create(NEPTUNE_ENDPOINT))
                .httpClientBuilder(ApacheHttpClient.builder()
                        .connectionTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(10))
                        .socketTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(30)))
                .overrideConfiguration(ClientOverrideConfiguration.builder()
                        .apiCallAttemptTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(30))
                        .build())
                .build();

        // Execute Gremlin Query
        logger.log("Executing Gremlin PROFILE query...\n");

        ExecuteGremlinQueryRequest queryRequest = ExecuteGremlinQueryRequest.builder()
                .gremlinQuery("g.V().hasLabel('person').values('name')")
                .build();

        ExecuteGremlinQueryResponse response = neptunedataClient.executeGremlinQuery(queryRequest);

        // Log full response as JSON
        logger.log("Full Response:\n");
        try {
            ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
            String jsonResponse = mapper.writerWithDefaultPrettyPrinter().writeValueAsString(response);
            logger.log(jsonResponse + "\n");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            logger.log("Failed to serialize response: " + e.getMessage() + "\n");
        }

        // Log result specifically
        if (response.result() != null) {
            logger.log("Query Result:\n" + response.result().toString() + "\n");
        } else {
            logger.log("No result returned from the query.\n");
        }

        return "Done";
    }
}

```

**Note**: Make sure that you assign your **NEPTUNE_ENDPOINT** with the Neptune endpoint. You can get this value by running the Neptune Basics scenario located in the code lib.  

## Package the project that contains the Lambda functions

Package up the project into a .jar (JAR) file by using the following Maven command.

    mvn clean package shade:shade

This creates a shaded JAR file that is located in the **target** folder (which is a child folder of the project folder). 

**Note**: The **maven-shade-plugin** is used in the project’s POM file. This plugin is responsible for creating a .jar file that contains the required dependencies. If you attempt to package up the project without this plugin, the required dependences are not included in the .jar file and you will encounter a **ClassNotFoundException**. 

## Deploy the Lambda function

You can deploy the Lambda function using the AWS CLI. Be sure to specify the correct VPC subnets and security group associated with your Neptune database. These values can be retrieved by running the Neptune Basics Scenario located in the AWS Code Library.

The following command creates a Lambda function configured to run inside your VPC:
 

```bash
aws lambda create-function \
  --function-name NeptuneLoader \
  --runtime java21 \
  --role arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/lambda-execution-role \
  --handler org.example.NeptuneLambdaHandler::handleRequest \
  --timeout 900 \
  --memory-size 1024 \
  --zip-file fileb://target/my-lambda-jar-with-dependencies.jar \
  --vpc-config SubnetIds=subnet-abcdxxxx,subnet-xyz9xxxx,SecurityGroupIds=sg-abc1xxxx

```
You're not required to explicitly specify the VPC ID in the **create-function** command. Instead, you specify the subnets and security groups, which together imply the VPC.

Ensure thay you specify the correct values such as the IAM role and the proper Lambda handler. 

###  Configure Security Group rules

To enable communication between your Lambda function and the Neptune database, you must configure the security 
group rules properly. You must allow inbound traffic on port 8182 from the Lambda function's security group. 
Use the following CLI command. 

``` bash

aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
  --group-id <neptune-sg-id> \
  --protocol tcp \
  --port 8182 \
  --source-group <lambda-sg-id> \
  --description "Allow Lambda SG access to Neptune on port 8182"

```
In addition, allow outbound traffic on port 8182 to the Neptune DB (by default, all outbound traffic is allowed — verify if restricted).

Use the following CLI command. 

``` bash
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-egress \
  --group-id <lambda-sg-id> \
  --protocol tcp \
  --port 8182 \
  --destination-group <neptune-sg-id> \
  --description "Allow Lambda to send traffic to Neptune on port 8182"
```

### Invoke your Lambda function

You can invoke the Lambda function using this CLI command. 

```bash
aws lambda invoke --function-name NeptuneLoader output.
```

You will see the following command line message.
```json
     {
    "StatusCode": 200,
    "ExecutedVersion": "$LATEST"
     }
```

Check the output.log for immediate output, but your logs will be detailed in CloudWatch.
 
### View CloudWatch Logs

After invoking your Lambda function, you can view the logs generated by the function in Amazon CloudWatch. Use the AWS CLI commands below to inspect the log groups, streams, and log events for your NeptuneLoader function:

#### Find the Log Group

```bash
aws logs describe-log-groups | grep NeptuneLoader
```

#### List Log Streams in the Log Group

```bash
aws logs describe-log-streams \
  --log-group-name /aws/lambda/NeptuneLoader \
  --order-by LastEventTime \
  --descending
```

This lists the available log streams sorted by the most recent activity.

#### View Log Events from a Specific Stream

Once you identify a logStreamName from the previous step, use the following command to fetch log events:

```bash
aws logs get-log-events \
  --log-group-name /aws/lambda/NeptuneLoader \
  --log-stream-name <your-log-stream-name>
```

Replace <your-log-stream-name> with the actual stream name returned in the previous command.

### Next steps
Congratulations, you have created a Lambda function that queries Neptune data. As stated at the beginning of this tutorial, be sure to delete all of the resources that you created during this tutorial so that you won't be charged.
