# Amazon Elastic Container Service Java code examples

This README discusses how to run and test the Java code examples for Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS).

## Running the Amazon Elastic Container Service Java files

The credential provider used in all code examples is ProfileCredentialsProvider. For more information, see [Using credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/credentials.html).

**IMPORTANT**

The Java examples perform AWS operations for the account and AWS Region for which you've specified credentials, and you may incur AWS service charges by running them. See the [AWS Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) for details about the charges you can expect for a given service and operation.

Some of these examples perform *destructive* operations on AWS resources, such as deleting an Amazon ECS service. **Be very careful** when running an operation that deletes or modifies AWS resources in your account. It's best to create separate test-only resources when experimenting with these examples.

To run these examples, you can setup your development environment to use Apache Maven or Gradle to configure and build AWS SDK for Java projects. For more information, 
see [Get started with the AWS SDK for Java 2.x](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/get-started.html). 


 ## Testing the Amazon Elastic Container Service files

You can test the Java code examples for Amazon Elastic Container Service by running a test file named **EcsTest**. This file uses JUnit 5 to run the JUnit tests and is located in the **src/test/java** folder. For more information, see [https://junit.org/junit5/](https://junit.org/junit5/).

You can execute the JUnit tests from a Java IDE, such as IntelliJ, or from the command line by using Maven. As each test is ran, you can view messages that inform you if the various tests succeed or fail. For example, the following message informs you that Test 3 passed.

	Test 3 passed

**WARNING**: _Running these JUnit tests manipulates real Amazon resources and may incur charges on your account._

 ### Properties file
Before running the Amazon ECS JUnit tests, you must define values in the **config.properties** file located in the **resources** folder. This file contains values that are required to execute the JUnit tests. For example, you can define a cluster name. If you do not define all values, the JUnit tests fail.

Define these values to successfully run the JUnit tests:

- **clusterName** - the name of the cluster to create.  
- **securityGroups** – the name of the security group.
- **subnet** - the name of the subnet used. 
- **taskId** - the task id value used in the ListTaskDefinitions test.
- **serviceName** - the name of the service to create. 
- **taskDefinition** - the name of the tasks definition which is used when you create a service. 


### Command line
To execute the JUnit tests from the command line, you can use the following command.

		mvn test

You will see output from the JUnit tests, as shown here.

### Unsuccessful tests

If you do not define the correct values in the properties file, your JUnit tests are not successful. You will see an error message such as the following. You need to double-check the values that you set in the properties file and run the tests again.
