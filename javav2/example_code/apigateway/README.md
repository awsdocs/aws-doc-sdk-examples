# Amazon API Gateway Java code examples

This README discusses how to run and test the Java code examples for Amazon API Gateway.

## Running the Amazon API Gateway Java files

**IMPORTANT**

The Java code examples perform AWS operations for the account and AWS Region for which you've specified credentials, and you may incur AWS service charges by running them. See the [AWS Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) for details about the charges you can expect for a given service and operation.

Some of these examples perform *destructive* operations on AWS resources, such as deleting a deployment. **Be very careful** when running an operation that deletes or modifies AWS resources in your account. It's best to create separate test-only resources when experimenting with these examples.

To run these examples, you can setup your development environment to use Apache Maven or Gradle to configure and build AWS SDK for Java projects. For more information,
see [Get started with the AWS SDK for Java 2.x](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/get-started.html).

 ## Testing the Amazon API Gateway Java files

You can test the Java code examples for Amazon API Gateway by running a test file named **APIGatewayTest**. This file uses JUnit 5 to run the JUnit tests and is located in the **src/test/java** folder. For more information, see [https://junit.org/junit5/](https://junit.org/junit5/).

You can run the JUnit tests from a Java IDE, such as IntelliJ, or from the command line by using Maven. As each test runs, you can view messages that inform you if the various tests succeed or fail. For example, the following message informs you that Test 3 passed.

	Test 3 passed

**WARNING**: _Running these JUnit tests manipulates real Amazon resources and may incur charges on your account._

 ### Properties file
Before running the  Amazon API Gateway JUnit tests, you must define values in the **config.properties** file located in the **resources** folder. This file contains values that are required to run the JUnit tests. For example, you define a rest Api Id value to use in the tests. If you do not define all values, the JUnit tests fail.

Define this value to successfully run the JUnit tests:

- **restApiId** - The string identifier of an existing RestApi (for example, xxxx99ewyg).
- **deploymentId** - The string identifier of an existing deployment.
- **httpMethod** - The HTTP method used in the **GetMethod** test (for example, GET).
- **restApiName** - The name to use for the new RestApi.
- **stageName** - The name of the stage used in the **CreateDeployment** test.

### Command line
To run the JUnit tests from the command line, you can use the following command.

		mvn test

You will see output from the JUnit tests, as shown here.

### Unsuccessful tests

If you do not define the correct values in the properties file, your JUnit tests are not successful. You will see an error message such as the following. You need to double-check the values that you set in the properties file and run the tests again.
