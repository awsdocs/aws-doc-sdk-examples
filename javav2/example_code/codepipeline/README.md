# AWS CodePipeline Java code examples

This README discusses how to run the Java code examples for AWS CodePipeline.

## Running the AWS CodePipeline Java files

The credential provider used in all code examples is the default credentials provider. For more information, see [Using credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/credentials.html).

**IMPORTANT**

The Java code examples perform AWS operations for the account and AWS Region for which you've specified credentials, and you may incur AWS service charges by running them. See the [AWS Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) for details about the charges you can expect for a given service and operation.

Some of these examples perform *destructive* operations on AWS resources, such as deleting an existing pipeline. **Be very careful** when running an operation that deletes or modifies AWS resources in your account. It's best to create separate test-only resources when experimenting with these examples.

To run these examples, you can setup your development environment. For more information,
see [Get started with the AWS SDK for Java 2.x](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-kotlin/latest/developer-guide/get-started.html).
