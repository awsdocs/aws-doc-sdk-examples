            Amazon Batch is a fully managed batch processing service that enables developers, scientists, and engineers to run batch 
            computing workloads of any scale. It dynamically provisions the optimal quantity and type of compute resources 
            (e.g., CPU or memory-optimized instances) based on the volume and specific resource requirements of the batch jobs submitted.
                        
            The Java V2 SDK allows you to interact with various AWS services programmatically. The `BatchAsyncClient` interface 
            in the Java V2 SDK enables developers to automate the submission, monitoring, and management of batch jobs on the Amazon Batch service.
                        
            In this scenario, we'll explore how to use the Java V2 SDK to interact with the Amazon Batch service, including:
                        
            1. **Create an AWS Batch Job Definition**: Define a job definition that is used to run your Docker container on Fargate. This job definition will include the Docker image location (ECR repository), the container properties, and the execution role that grants the necessary permissions.
                        
            2. **Submit an AWS Batch Job**: Submit a job to AWS Batch, specifying the job definition you created in the previous step. This will trigger the process of pulling the Docker image from ECR and launching the container on Fargate.
                        
            3. **Monitor the Job Execution**: AWS Batch will handle the execution of the job on Fargate, including pulling the Docker image from ECR, starting the container, and monitoring its execution.
                        
            Let's get started...
                        
            You have two choices:
            1 - Run the entire program.
            2 - Delete an existing Compute Environment (created from a previous execution of 
            this program that did not complete).

            An Amazon Batch compute environment is a resource where you can run your batch jobs.

            you can create:
            
            The benefit of creating a compute environment is it allows you to easily configure and manage the compute 
            resources that will be used to run your Batch jobs. By separating the compute environment from the job definitions,
            you can easily scale your compute resources up or down as needed, without having to modify your job definitions. 
            This makes it easier to manage your Batch workloads and ensures that your jobs have the necessary 
            compute resources to run efficiently.

            Submit Jobs: You can submit batch jobs to the compute environment for execution. Jobs can be containerized applications or scripts.

            Define Job Definitions: Create job definitions that specify how jobs are to be run, including parameters, environment variables, and resource requirements.
            Types of Jobs
            Batch Processing Jobs: Process large volumes of data, such as ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations, image processing, and video transcoding.
            Machine Learning Jobs: Train machine learning models or run inference tasks using frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn.
