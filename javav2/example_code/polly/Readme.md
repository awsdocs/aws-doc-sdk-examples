#  Amazon Polly Java code examples

This README discusses how to run and test the Java code examples for Amazon Polly.

## Running the Amazon Polly Java files

**IMPORTANT**

The Java examples perform AWS operations for the account and AWS Region for which you've specified credentials, and you may incur AWS service charges by running them. See the [AWS Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) for details about the charges you can expect for a given service and operation.

To run these examples, you can setup your development environment to use Apache Maven or Gradle to configure and build AWS SDK for Java projects. For more information, 
see [Get started with the AWS SDK for Java 2.x](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/get-started.html).


 ## Testing the Amazon Polly Java files

You can test the Java code examples for Amazon Polly by running a test file named **AWSPollyServiceIntegrationTest**. This file uses JUnit 5 to run the JUnit tests and is located in the **src/test/java** folder. For more information, see [https://junit.org/junit5/](https://junit.org/junit5/).

You can execute the tests from a Java IDE, such as IntelliJ, or from the command line by using Maven. As each test is executed, you can view messages that inform you if the various tests succeed or fail. For example, the following message informs you that Test 3 passed.

	Test 3 passed

### Command line
To execute the JUnit tests from the command line, you can use the following command.

		mvn test

You will see output from the JUnit tests, as shown here.
