# AWS SDK for Rust code examples for AWS IoT

## Purpose

These examples demonstrate how to perform several AWS IoT operations using the developer preview version of the AWS SDK for Rust.

AWS IoT provides secure, bi-directional communication for Internet-connected devices (such as sensors, actuators, embedded devices, wireless devices, and smart appliances) to connect to the AWS Cloud over MQTT, HTTPS, and LoRaWAN.

## Code examples

- [Display the address of an endpoint](src/bin/describe-endpoints.rs) (DescribeEndpoints)
- [List your things](src/bin/list-core-devices.rs) (ListThings)

## ⚠ Important

- We recommend that you grant this code least privilege, 
  or at most the minimum permissions required to perform the task.
  For more information, see
  [Grant Least Privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege)
  in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide.
- This code has not been tested in all AWS Regions.
  Some AWS services are available only in specific
  [Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).
- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.

## Running the code examples

### Prerequisites

You must have an AWS account, and have configured your default credentials and AWS Region as described in [https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust).

### list-core-devices

This example lists the name, type, and ARN of your IoT things in the Region. 

`cargo run --bin list-core-devices -- [-r REGION] [-v]`

- _REGION_ is the Region in which the client is created.
  If not supplied, uses the value of the __AWS_REGION__ environment variable.
  If the environment variable is not set, defaults to __us-west-2__.
- __-v__ displays additional information.

## Contributing

To propose a new code example to the AWS documentation team, 
see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). 
The team prefers to create code examples that show broad scenarios rather than individual API calls.
