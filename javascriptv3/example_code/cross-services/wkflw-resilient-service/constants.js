  introduction: `Welcome to the demonstration of How to Build and Manage a Resilient Service!
For this demo, we'll use an AWS SDK to create several AWS resources to set up a load-balanced web service endpoint and explore some ways to make it resilient against various kinds of failures.
Some of the resources create by this demo are:
  - A DynamoDB table that the web service depends on to provide book, movie, and song recommendations.
  - An EC2 launch template that defines EC2 instances that each contain a Python web server.
  - An EC2 Auto Scaling group that manages EC2 instances across several Availability Zones.
  - An Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) load balancer that targets the Auto Scaling group to distribute requests.`,

For demo purposes, this server is run as the root user. In production, the best practice is to run a web server, such as Apache, with least-privileged credentials.

  demoTestBrokenDependency:
    "Setting demo parameter doc-example-resilient-architecture-table to ${TABLE_NAME}. Now, sending a GET request to the load balancer endpoint returns a failure code.

  demoDeepHealthCheckConfirmation:
    "For this demo, a deep health check tests whether the web service can access the DynamoDB table that it depends on for recommendations. Note that the deep health check is only for ELB routing and not for Auto Scaling instance health. This kind of deep health check is not recommended for Auto Scaling instance health, because it risks accidental termination of all instances in the Auto Scaling group when a dependent service fails. By implementing deep health checks, the load balancer can detect when one of the instances is failing and take that instance out of rotation. Do you want to continue?",
  demoTestDeepHealthCheck:
    "Now, checking target health indicates that the instance with bad credentials is unhealthy. Note that it might take a minute or two for the load balancer to detect the unhealthy instance. Sending a GET request to the load balancer endpoint always returns a recommendation, because the load balancer takes unhealthy instances out of it rotation.",
  demoKillInstanceConfirmation:
    "Because the instances in this demo are controlled by an auto scaler, the simplest way to fix an unhealthy instance is to terminate it and let the auto scaler start a new instance to replace it. Do you want to terminate instance ${INSTANCE_ID}?",
  demoTestKillInstance:
    "The instance is terminating. While the instance is terminating and the new instance is starting, sending a GET request to the web service continues to get a successful recommendation response because the load balancer routes requests to the healthy instances. After the replacement instance starts and reports as healthy, it is included in the load balancing rotation. Note that terminating and replacing an instance typically takes several minutes, during which time you can see the changing health check status until the new instance is running and healthy.",
  demoFailOpenConfirmation:
    "The last phase of the example sets the table name parameter to a fake table to simulate a failure of the recommendation service. Now, this will cause all instances to report as unhealthy. Do you want to continue?",
  demoFailOpenTest:
    "The parameter has been modified. When all instances are unhealthy, the load balancer continues to route requests to unhealthy instances. This allows them to 'fail open' and return a static response instead of 'fail closed' and report a failure.",
