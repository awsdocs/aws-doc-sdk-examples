# AWS SDK for SAP-ABAP

## Purpose

These examples demonstrate how to perform several operations using the AWS SDK for SAP ABAP.

## âš  Important

- We recommend that you grant this code least privilege, or at most the minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see [Grant Least Privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege) in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide.
- This code has not been tested in all AWS Regions. Some AWS services are available only in specific [Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).
- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.
- The included unit tests have been marked as `DANGEROUS` and will create and delete AWS assets. Only run these in a suitable test AWS account.

## Examples Layout

### `services`

Examples show how to use the AWS SDK for SAP-ABAP using single actions and services. These are actions with individual examples.
