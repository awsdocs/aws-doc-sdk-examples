CloudFormation Templates
THE LICENSE FILE APPLIES TO ALL FILES IN THIS FOLDER.

These files are example CloudFormation Templates that show how to provision and manage AWS resources. CloudFormation Template files are formatted text files in JSON or YAML. 

It is your responsibility to review each template for its applicability to your environment and its completeness, both in terms of syntax and whether the sample provides a complete solution for your scenario. Because JSON does not support comments, these examples do not have any kind of explanation accompanying them. We recommend that you view these examples in the context of our documentation. There you'll find a description for the example, often with an explanation of how the policy operates.

Each file is formatted as JSON. For more information, see Introducing JSON <https://json.org>.
