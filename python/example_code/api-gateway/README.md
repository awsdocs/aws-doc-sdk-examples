# API Gateway code examples for the SDK for Python

## Overview

Shows how to use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to work with Amazon API Gateway.

<!--custom.overview.start-->
<!--custom.overview.end-->

*API Gateway enables you to create and deploy your own REST and WebSocket APIs at any scale.*

## ⚠ Important

* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account. For more details, see [AWS Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/?aws-products-pricing.sort-by=item.additionalFields.productNameLowercase&aws-products-pricing.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Type=*all&awsf.tech-category=*all) and [Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=*all&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=*all).
* Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.
* We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege).
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

## Code examples

### Prerequisites

For prerequisites, see the [README](../../README.md#Prerequisites) in the `python` folder.

Install the packages required by these examples by running the following in a virtual environment:

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<!--custom.prerequisites.start-->
<!--custom.prerequisites.end-->

### Single actions

Code excerpts that show you how to call individual service functions.

* [Add a response from an AWS service integrated with a method](aws_service/aws_service.py#L25) (`PutIntegrationResponse`)
* [Add an HTTP method to a REST resource](aws_service/aws_service.py#L25) (`PutMethod`)
* [Add an HTTP response to a REST resource](aws_service/aws_service.py#L25) (`PutMethodResponse`)
* [Create a REST API](aws_service/aws_service.py#L41) (`CreateRestApi`)
* [Create a REST resource](aws_service/aws_service.py#L73) (`CreateResource`)
* [Delete a REST API](aws_service/aws_service.py#L228) (`DeleteRestApi`)
* [Deploy a REST API](aws_service/aws_service.py#L164) (`CreateDeployment`)
* [Get REST resources](aws_service/aws_service.py#L25) (`GetResources`)
* [Integrate a method with an AWS service](aws_service/aws_service.py#L94) (`PutIntegration`)
* [List REST APIs](aws_service/aws_service.py#L201) (`GetRestApis`)

### Scenarios

Code examples that show you how to accomplish a specific task by calling multiple
functions within the same service.

* [Create and deploy a REST API](aws_service/aws_service.py)

### Cross-service examples

Sample applications that work across multiple AWS services.

* [Create a REST API to track COVID-19 data](../../cross_service/apigateway_covid-19_tracker)
* [Create a lending library REST API](../../cross_service/aurora_rest_lending_library)
* [Create a websocket chat application](../../cross_service/apigateway_websocket_chat)
* [Use API Gateway to invoke a Lambda function](../../example_code/lambda)

## Run the examples

### Instructions


<!--custom.instructions.start-->
<!--custom.instructions.end-->



#### Create and deploy a REST API

This example shows you how to do the following:

* Create a REST API served by API Gateway.
* Add resources to the REST API to represent a user profile.
* Add integration methods so that the REST API uses a DynamoDB table to store user profile data.
* Send HTTP requests to the REST API to add and retrieve user profiles.

<!--custom.scenario_prereqs.api-gateway_Usage_CreateDeployRest.start-->
<!--custom.scenario_prereqs.api-gateway_Usage_CreateDeployRest.end-->

Start the example by running the following at a command prompt:

```
python aws_service/aws_service.py
```


<!--custom.scenarios.api-gateway_Usage_CreateDeployRest.start-->
For additional instructions on how to set up and run this example, see the 
[README](aws_service/README.md) in the `aws_service` folder.
<!--custom.scenarios.api-gateway_Usage_CreateDeployRest.end-->

### Tests

⚠ Running tests might result in charges to your AWS account.


To find instructions for running these tests, see the [README](../../README.md#Tests)
in the `python` folder.
