Important

The AWS SDKs sign API requests for you using the access key that you specify when you
configure the SDK. When you use an SDK, you donâ€™t need to learn how to sign API requests.
We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to send API requests, instead of writing your own code.

The following example is a reference to help you get started if you have a need to write
your own code to send and sign requests. The example is for reference only and is not
maintained as functional code.

# ************* TASK 1: CREATE A CANONICAL REQUEST *************
# http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4-create-canonical-request.html

# Step 1 is to define the verb (GET, POST, etc.)--already done.

# Step 2: Create canonical URI--the part of the URI from domain to query
# string (use '/' if no path)
canonical_uri = "/"

# Step 3: Create the canonical query string. In this example (a GET request),
# request parameters are in the query string. Query string values must
# be URL-encoded (space=%20). The parameters must be sorted by name.
# For this example, the query string is pre-formatted in the
# request_parameters variable.
canonical_querystring = request_parameters

# Step 4: Create the canonical headers and signed headers. Header names
# must be trimmed and lowercase, and sorted in code point order from
# low to high. Note that there is a trailing \n.
canonical_headers = "host:" + host + "\n" + "x-amz-date:" + amzdate + "\n"

# Step 5: Create the list of signed headers. This lists the headers
# in the canonical_headers list, delimited with ";" and in alpha order.
# Note: The request can include any headers; canonical_headers and
# signed_headers lists those that you want to be included in the
# hash of the request. "Host" and "x-amz-date" are always required.
signed_headers = "host;x-amz-date"

# Step 6: Create payload hash (hash of the request body content). For GET
# requests, the payload is an empty string ("").
payload_hash = hashlib.sha256(b"").hexdigest()

# Step 7: Combine elements to create canonical request

# and (for this scenario) "Authorization". "host" and "x-amz-date" must

# earlier. Order here is not significant.
# Python note: The 'host' header is added automatically by the Python
# 'requests' library.
