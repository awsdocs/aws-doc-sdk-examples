"""
Purpose

Shows how to use AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to create an IAM user, assume a role,
and perform AWS actions.

1. Create a user who has no permissions.
2. Create a role that grants permission to list Amazon S3 buckets for the account.
3. Add a policy to let the user assume the role.
4. Assume the role and list Amazon S3 buckets using temporary credentials.
5. Delete the policy, role, and user.
