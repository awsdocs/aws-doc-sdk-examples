Overview

Shows how to use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) with AWS Glue to:

1. Create and run a crawler that crawls a public Amazon Simple Storage
   Service (Amazon S3) bucket and generates a metadata database that describes the
   CSV-formatted data it finds.
2. List information about databases and tables in your AWS Glue Data Catalog.
3. Create and run a job that extracts CSV data from the source S3 bucket,
   transforms it by removing and renaming fields, and loads JSON-formatted output into
   another Amazon S3 bucket.
4. List information about job runs and view some of the transformed data.
5. Delete all resources created by the example.
