_Kinesis makes it easy to collect, process, and analyze video and data streams in real time._

## ⚠ Important

* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account. For more details, see [AWS Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) and [Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/).
* Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.
* We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege).
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

## Run the examples

### Instructions


<!--custom.instructions.start-->
The action examples in this section are demonstrated as part of an Amazon Managed Service
for Apache Flink scenario that reads data from an input stream, uses SQL code to transform
the data, and writes it to an output stream. Run the scenario at a command prompt in
the `kinesis-analytics-v2` folder with the following command:

```
python kinesisanalyticsv2_demo.py
```
<!--custom.instructions.end-->



### Tests

⚠ Running tests might result in charges to your AWS account.


To find instructions for running these tests, see the [README](../../README.md#Tests)
in the `python` folder.
