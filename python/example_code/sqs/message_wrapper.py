"""
Purpose
    Demonstrate basic message operations in Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS).
    Learn how to send, receive, and delete messages from a queue.
    Usage is shown in the test/test_message_wrapper.py file.

Prerequisites
    - You must have an AWS account, and have your default credentials and AWS Region
      configured as described in the [AWS Tools and SDKs Shared Configuration and
      Credentials Reference Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/creds-config-files.html).
    - Python 3.6 or later
    - Boto 3 1.11.10 or later
    - PyTest 5.3.5 or later (to run unit tests)

Running the tests
    The best way to learn how to use this service is to run the tests.
    For instructions on testing, see the docstring in test/test_message_wrapper.py.

Running the code
    Run individual functions in the Python shell to make requests to your AWS account.

        > python
        >>> import queue_wrapper
        >>> queue = queue_wrapper.create_queue("My-test-queue")
        >>> message_wrapper.send_message(queue, "Test message")
        >>> messages = message_wrapper.receive_messages(queue, 10, 10)
        >>> messages[0].body
        'Test message'
        >>> queue_wrapper.remove_queue(queue)

Additional information
    Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.
