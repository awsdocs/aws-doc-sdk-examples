    Each Elastic Transcoder job/JobMonitor must have its own SqsWorker
    object. The SqsWorker handles messages for the job. Messages for other
    jobs are ignored.

    The SysWorker performs its task in a separate process. The JobMonitor
    starts the process by calling SysWorker.start().

    While the SysWorker process is handling job notifications, the JobMonitor
    parent process can perform other tasks, including starting new jobs with
    new JobMonitor and SqsWorker objects.

    When the Transcoder job is finished, a SysWorker flag is set. The
    JobMonitor parent process must periodically retrieve the current setting
    of the flag by calling SysWorker.finished().

    When the Transcoder job has finished, the JobMonitor parent process must
    terminate the SysWorker process by calling SysWorker.stop().

    The final result of the completed job can be retrieved by calling
    SysWorker.job_status().
