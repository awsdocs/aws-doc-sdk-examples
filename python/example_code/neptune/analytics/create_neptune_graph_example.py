Running this example.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VPC Networking Requirement:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amazon Neptune must be accessed from **within the same VPC** as the Neptune cluster.
It does not expose a public endpoint, so this code must be executed from:

  - An **AWS Lambda function** configured to run inside the same VPC
  - An **EC2 instance** or **ECS task** running in the same VPC
  - A connected environment such as a **VPN**, **AWS Direct Connect**, or a **peered VPC**
