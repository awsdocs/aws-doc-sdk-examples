"""
Use Boto 3 managed file transfers to manage multipart uploads to and downloads
from an Amazon S3 bucket.

When the file to transfer is larger than the specified threshold, the transfer
manager automatically uses multipart uploads or downloads. This demonstration
shows how to use several of the available transfer manager settings and reports
thread usage and time to transfer.
