# Amazon S3 Batch for the SDK for Python (boto3)

## Overview

This example demonstrates how to use the AWS SDK for Python (boto3) to work with Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) Batch Scenario. The scenario covers various operations such as creating an AWS Batch compute environment, creating a job queue, creating a job defination, and submitting a job, and so on.

Here are the top six service operations this scenario covers.

1. **Create an AWS Batch computer environment**: Creates an AWS Batch computer environment.

2. **Sets up a job queue**: Creates a job queue that will manage the submission of jobs.

3. **Creates a job definition**: Creates a job definition that specifies how the jobs should be executed.

4. **Registers a Job Definition**: Registers a job definition making it available for job submissions.

5. **Submits a Batch Job**: Submits a job.

6. **Checks the status of the job**: Checks the status of the job.
