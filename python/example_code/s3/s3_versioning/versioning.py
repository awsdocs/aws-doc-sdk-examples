Purpose

Demonstrates how to set up an Amazon S3 bucket for versioning, and how to perform
basic tasks on a version-enabled bucket.

For more detail, including usage and testing instructions, see the README.

Running this demo uses your default AWS credentials to create resources in your
account and my incur charges.
