Shows how to use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to work with AWS Organizations.

<!--custom.overview.start-->

*Organizations consolidates multiple AWS accounts into an organization that you create and centrally manage.*

## ⚠ Important

* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account. For more details, see [AWS Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/?aws-products-pricing.sort-by=item.additionalFields.productNameLowercase&aws-products-pricing.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Type=*all&awsf.tech-category=*all) and [Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=*all&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=*all).
* Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.
* We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege).
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

## Run the examples

### Instructions


<!--custom.instructions.start-->
Run this example at a command prompt with the following command.

```
python organizations_policies.py [--target TARGET]
``` 

The example optionally attaches and detaches the demo policy to an AWS Organizations
resource, such as a root organization or account. If you want to include this in the
demo, replace `TARGET` in the command with the ID of the resource.
