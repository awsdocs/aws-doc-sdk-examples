        This method uses the `boto3` library to interact with the Bedrock AI service,
        retrieving a list of foundation models. Each model's ID is then logged using
        a custom logger. The method is decorated with `@timeit` to measure its execution time.

        Exception Handling:
            Catches and logs exceptions that may occur during the interaction with the Bedrock service.

        Logging:
            Logs the total number of models found and each model's ID at DEBUG level. If no models are found
            or an exception occurs, appropriate warnings or errors are logged.
