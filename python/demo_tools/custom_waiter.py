    """
    Base class for a custom waiter that leverages botocore's waiter code. Waiters
    poll an operation, with a specified delay between each polling attempt, until
    either an accepted result is returned or the number of maximum attempts is reached.

    To use, implement a subclass that passes the specific operation, arguments,
    and acceptors to the superclass.

    For example, to implement a custom waiter for the transcription client that
    waits for both success and failure outcomes of the get_transcription_job function,
    create a class like the following:

        class TranscribeCompleteWaiter(CustomWaiter):
        def __init__(self, client):
            super().__init__(
                'TranscribeComplete', 'GetTranscriptionJob',
                'TranscriptionJob.TranscriptionJobStatus',
                {'COMPLETED': WaitState.SUCCESS, 'FAILED': WaitState.FAILURE},
                client)

        def wait(self, job_name):
            self._wait(TranscriptionJobName=job_name)

    """

        self,

        """
        Subclasses should pass specific operations, arguments, and acceptors to
        their superclass.

        :param name: The name of the waiter. This can be any descriptive string.
        :param operation: The operation to wait for. This must match the casing of
                          the underlying operation model, which is typically in
                          CamelCase.
        :param argument: The dict keys used to access the result of the operation, in
                         dot notation. For example, 'Job.Status' will access
                         result['Job']['Status'].
        :param acceptors: The list of acceptors that indicate the wait is over. These
                          can indicate either success or failure. The acceptor values
                          are compared to the result of the operation after the
                          argument keys are applied.
        :param client: The Boto3 client.
        :param delay: The number of seconds to wait between each call to the operation.
        :param max_tries: The maximum number of tries before exiting.
        :param matcher: The kind of matcher to use.
