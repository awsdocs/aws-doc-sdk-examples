    Shows you how to use the &Python3long; to create a web application that
    lets you upload photos to an &S3long; (&S3;) bucket, use &REKlong;
    to analyze and label the photos, and use &SESlong; (&SES;) to send email
    reports of image analysis.
    </para>

    <para>
    This example contains two main components: a web page written in JavaScript that is
    built with React, and a REST service written in Python that is built with
    Flask-RESTful.
    </para>

    <para>You can use the React web page to:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>Display a list of images that are stored in your &S3; bucket.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Upload images from your computer to your &S3; bucket.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Display images and labels that identify items that were detected in the image.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Get a report of all images in your &S3; bucket and send an email of the report.</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The web page calls the REST service. The service sends requests to
        &AWS; to perform the following actions:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>Get and filter the list of images in your &S3; bucket.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Upload photos to your &S3; bucket.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Use &REK; to analyze individual photos and get a list of labels that
             identify items that are detected in the photo.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Analyze all photos in your &S3; bucket and use &SES; to email a report.</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
