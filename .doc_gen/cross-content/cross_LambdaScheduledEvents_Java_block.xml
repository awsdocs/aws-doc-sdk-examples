        Shows how to create an &EVlong; scheduled event that invokes an &LAMlong; function.
        Configure &EV; to use a cron expression to schedule when the &LAM; function is invoked.
        In this example, you create a &LAM; function by using the &LAM; Java runtime API.
        This example invokes different &AWS; services to perform a specific use case. This example demonstrates how to
        create an app that sends a mobile text message to your employees that congratulates 
        them at the one year anniversary date.
