## Code examples

### Prerequisites

For prerequisites, see the [README](../../README.md#Prerequisites) in the `php` folder.


<!--custom.prerequisites.start-->
- [PHP](https://www.php.net/) version 8.2 or higher
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org), for dependency management
- You must have an AWS account, and have your default credentials and AWS Region
  configured as described in the
  [AWS Tools and SDKs Shared Configuration and Credentials Reference Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/creds-config-files.html).

> ⚠ You must request access to a model before you can use it. If you try to use the model (with the API or console) before you have requested access to it, you will receive an error message. For more information, see [Model access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html).
