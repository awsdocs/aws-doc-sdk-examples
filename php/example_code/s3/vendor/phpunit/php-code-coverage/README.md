## Installation

You can add this library as a local, per-project dependency to your project using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```
composer require phpunit/php-code-coverage
```

If you only need this library during development, for instance to run your project's test suite, then you should add it as a development-time dependency:

```
composer require --dev phpunit/php-code-coverage
```

## Usage

```php
<?php
use SebastianBergmann\CodeCoverage\CodeCoverage;

$coverage = new CodeCoverage;

$coverage->filter()->addDirectoryToWhitelist('/path/to/src');

$coverage->start('<name of test>');

// ...

$coverage->stop();

$writer = new \SebastianBergmann\CodeCoverage\Report\Clover;
$writer->process($coverage, '/tmp/clover.xml');

$writer = new \SebastianBergmann\CodeCoverage\Report\Html\Facade;
$writer->process($coverage, '/tmp/code-coverage-report');
```
