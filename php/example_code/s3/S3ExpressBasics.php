/**
 * Purpose
 *
 * Shows how to use AWS SDK for PHP v3 to get started using Amazon S3 Express One Zone.
 * Create a Directory bucket, move objects into and out of it, and delete all
 * resources at the end of the demo. This demo will showcase topics specific to S3
 * Express One Zone such as authentication sessions.
 *
 * You will need to run the following command to install dependencies:
 * composer install
 *
 * Then run the example either directly with:
 * php S3ExpressBasics.php
 *
 * or as a PHPUnit test:
 * vendor/bin/phpunit S3ExpressBasicsTests.php

Let's get started! First, please note that S3 Express One Zone works best when working within the AWS infrastructure,

Directory buckets into your infrastructure, it is best to put your Compute resources in the same AZ as your Directory
bucket.\n
