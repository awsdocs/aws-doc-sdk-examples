# Amazon Lex Kotlin code examples

This README discusses how to run the Kotlin code examples for Amazon Lex.

## Running the Amazon Lex Kotlin files

**IMPORTANT**

The Kotlin code examples perform AWS operations for the account and AWS Region for which you've specified credentials, and you may incur AWS service charges by running them. See the [AWS Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) for details about the charges you can expect for a given service and operation.

Some of these examples perform *destructive* operations on AWS resources, such as deleting an Amazon Lex conversational bot. **Be very careful** when running an operation that deletes or modifies AWS resources in your account. It's best to create separate test-only resources when experimenting with these examples.

You will find these examples: 

- **DeleteBot** - Demonstrates how to delete an Amazon Lex conversational bot.
- **GetBots** - Demonstrates how to return information about Amazon Lex chatbots.
- **GetBotStatus** - Demonstrates how to get the status of an Amazon Lex bot.
- **GetIntent** - Demonstrates how to get intent information from an Amazon Lex conversational bot.
- **GetSlotTypes** - Demonstrates how to return slot type information.
- **PostText** - Demonstrates how to send text to an Amazon Lex conversational bot.
- **PutBot** - Demonstrates how to create an Amazon Lex conversational bot.

To run these examples, you can setup your development environment to use Gradle to configure and build AWS SDK for Kotlin projects. For more information, 
see [Get started with the AWS SDK for Kotlin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-kotlin/latest/developer-guide/setup.html).
