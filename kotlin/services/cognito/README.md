#  Amazon Cognito code examples for the SDK for Kotlin

## Overview
This README discusses how to run and test the AWS SDK for Kotlin examples for Amazon Cognito.

Amazon Cognito is a simple user identity and data synchronization service that helps you securely manage and synchronize app data for your users across their mobile devices.

## ⚠️ Important
* The SDK for Kotlin examples perform AWS operations for the account and AWS Region for which you've specified credentials. Running these examples might incur charges on your account. For details about the charges you can expect for a given service and API operation, see [AWS Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/).
* Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.
* We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege).
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

## Code examples

### Single action

The following examples use the **CognitoIdentityClient** object:

- [Creating an Amazon Cognito identity pool](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/kotlin/services/cognito/src/main/kotlin/com/kotlin/cognito/CreateIdentityPool.kt) (createIdentityPool command)
- [Deleting an existing Amazon Cognito identity pool](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/kotlin/services/cognito/src/main/kotlin/com/kotlin/cognito/DeleteIdentityPool.kt) (deleteIdentityPool command)
- [Listing identities that belong to an Amazon Cognito identity pool](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/kotlin/services/cognito/src/main/kotlin/com/kotlin/cognito/ListIdentities.kt) (listIdentities command)
- [Listing Amazon Cognito identity pools](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/kotlin/services/cognito/src/main/kotlin/com/kotlin/cognito/ListIdentityPools.kt) (listIdentityPools command)

The following examples use the **CognitoIdentityProviderClient** object:

- [Adding a new user to your user pool](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/kotlin/services/cognito/src/main/kotlin/com/kotlin/cognito/CreateUser.kt) (adminCreateUser command)
- [Creating a user pool for Amazon Cognito](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/kotlin/services/cognito/src/main/kotlin/com/kotlin/cognito/CreateUserPool.kt) (createUserPool command)
- [Deleting an existing user pool](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/kotlin/services/cognito/src/main/kotlin/com/kotlin/cognito/DeleteUserPool.kt) (deleteUserPool command)
- [Obtaining information about an existing user pool](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/kotlin/services/cognito/src/main/kotlin/com/kotlin/cognito/DescribeUserPool.kt) (describeUserPool command)
- [Listing existing user pools](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/kotlin/services/cognito/src/main/kotlin/com/kotlin/cognito/ListUserPools.kt) (listUserPools command)
- [Listing existing users in the specified user pool](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/kotlin/services/cognito/src/main/kotlin/com/kotlin/cognito/ListUsers.kt) (listUsers command)
- [Registering a user in the specified Amazon Cognito user pool](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/kotlin/services/cognito/src/main/kotlin/com/kotlin/cognito/SignUpUser.kt) (signUp command)

The following example is an Amazon Cognito scenario:

- [Signing up a new user with Amazon Cognito and associate the user with an MFA application for multi-factor authentication](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/kotlin/services/cognito/src/main/kotlin/com/kotlin/cognito/CognitoMVP.kt) (various commands)

## Running the Amazon Cognito Kotlin files

**IMPORTANT**

The Kotlin examples perform AWS operations for the account and AWS Region for which you've specified credentials, and you may incur AWS service charges by running them. See the [AWS Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) for details about the charges you can expect for a given service and operation.

Some of these examples perform *destructive* operations on AWS resources, such as deleting a user pool. **Be very careful** when running an operation that deletes or modifies AWS resources in your account. It's best to create separate test-only resources when experimenting with these examples.

To run these examples, you can setup your development environment to use Gradle to configure and build AWS SDK for Kotlin projects. For more information,
see [Get started with the AWS SDK for Kotlin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-kotlin/latest/developer-guide/get-started.html).


 ## Testing the Amazon Cognito files

You can test the Kotlin code examples for Amazon Cognito by running a test file named **CognitoKotlinTest**. This file uses JUnit 5 to run the JUnit tests and is located in the **src/test/kotlin** folder. For more information, see [https://junit.org/junit5/](https://junit.org/junit5/).

You can execute the JUnit tests from an IDE, such as IntelliJ, or from the command line by using Maven. As each test is run, you can view messages that inform you if the various tests succeed or fail. For example, the following message informs you that Test 3 passed.

	Test 3 passed

**WARNING**: _Running these JUnit tests manipulates real Amazon resources and may incur charges on your account._

 ### Properties file
Before running the Amazon Cognito JUnit tests, you must define values in the **config.properties** file located in the **resources** folder. This file contains values that are required to execute the JUnit tests. For example, you define an instance name used for various tests. If you do not define all values, the JUnit tests fail.

Define these values to successfully run the JUnit tests:

- **userPoolName** - The name of the user pool that is created.
- **username** – The user name that is used in the **CreateAdminUser** test.
- **email** - The user email that is used in the **CreateAdminUser** test.
- **clientName** - The client name that is used in the **CreateUserPoolClient** test.
- **identityPoolName** - The pool name used in the **CreateIdentityPool** test.
- **confirmationCode** - The confirmation code that is used in the **ConfirmSignUp** test.

### Command line
To execute the JUnit tests from the command line, you can use the following command.

		mvn test
