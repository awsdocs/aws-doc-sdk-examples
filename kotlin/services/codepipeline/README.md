# AWS CodePipeline Kotlin code examples

This README discusses how to run the Kotlin code examples for AWS CodePipeline.

## Running the AWS CodePipeline Kotlin files

**IMPORTANT**

The Kotlin code examples perform AWS operations for the account and AWS Region for which you've specified credentials, and you may incur AWS service charges by running them. See the [AWS Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) for details about the charges you can expect for a given service and operation.

Some of these examples perform *destructive* operations on AWS resources, such as deleting an existing pipeline. **Be very careful** when running an operation that deletes or modifies AWS resources in your account. It's best to create separate test-only resources when experimenting with these examples.

You will find these examples:

- **CreatePipeline** - Demonstrates how to create a pipeline.
- **DeletePipeline** - Demonstrates how to delete a pipeline.
- **GetPipeline** - Demonstrates how to retrieve a specific pipeline.
- **ListPipelineExecutions** - Demonstrates how to all executions for a specific pipeline.
- **ListPipelines** - Demonstrates how to retrieve all pipelines.
- **StartPipelineExecution** - Demonstrates how to execute a pipeline.

To run these examples, you can setup your development environment to use Gradle to configure and build AWS SDK for Kotlin projects. For more information,
see [Get started with the AWS SDK for Kotlin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-kotlin/latest/developer-guide/setup.html).
