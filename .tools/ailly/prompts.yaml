      Learning levels

      Use learning levels as a way to help customers filter content and find the right content at the right time.
      * Foundational (100): This content introduces the audience to AWS services or features, with an assumption of zero or minimal AWS knowledge. Authors explain basic use cases, functionality, and benefits, and offer resources to get started.
      * Intermediate (200): This content focuses on providing an overview of AWS services or features, with the assumption that the audience has a working knowledge of the topic. Authors highlight common use cases, using multiple services or features, functionality, and benefits.
      * Advanced (300): This content dives deeper into the selected topic. Authors assume that the audience has familiarity with the topic but may not have direct experience implementing a similar solution. Code may be shared, but this is not the primary focus of the content.
      * Expert (400): This content is for an audience that is deeply familiar with the topic, has implemented similar solutions already, and is comfortable with how the technology works across multiple services, architectures, and implementations. Authors dive into code, cover advanced tricks, and explore future developments in the technology.
    sdk_code_example_tributary: A code example "Tributary" is a code example not written
      by the TCX Code Examples team, but that is published through metadata and tooling
      into the Example Code Library and related docs. This code appears directly in
      the Example Code Library.
    sdk_code_example_workflow: A Workflow Example, as defined by the TCX Code Examples
      team, is an example scenario that is targeted to a particular real-world user
      story, use case, problem, or other common service integration. It may use one
      or more than one service, and it does not necessarily target a specific set
      of actions in a single service. Instead, it focuses directly on a specific task
      or set of service iterations. It should still be a running example, at minimum
      using command line interactions, and should focus on a specific task using AWS
      services and features.
    tcx_introductions: |
      <introduction-guide>
        An introduction is your first chance to give readers a basic understanding of the content ahead. Your task is to show them how the product or feature works and why they should consider using it.
        The other important function of the introduction is to present keywords that help browsers find the topic.
        Introduction writing process:
        A. State the formal name of the product or feature. Use entities to ensure consistency.
        B. Describe succinctly what it does or how it works.
        C. Give an example showing how to take advantage of the product or feature.
        D. As applicable, tell readers where to find more info, such as tutorials and references.
        Here are some example introductions:
        <introduction-examples>
          Example 1:
          Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides resizable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. Using Amazon EC2 eliminates your need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy applications faster. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage. With Amazon EC2 you can scale up or down to handle changes in requirements or spikes in popularity, reducing your need to forecast traffic. 
          The next example shows a typical introduction for a feature of a service.
          Example 2:
          Amazon CloudWatch uses Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to send email. This section shows you how to create and subscribe to an Amazon SNS topic. When you create a CloudWatch alarm, you can add this Amazon SNS topic to send an email notification when the alarm changes state.

    tcx_prodedure_guide: |
      <procedure-guide>
      A procedure is a series of numbered steps that a user follows to complete a specific task. Users should be able to scan for and recognize procedures easily. Make procedures recognizable by using the following:
      * Predictable content parts
      * Parallel language constructions
      * Consistent formatting
      You typically use procedures for console steps, but you can also use them for AWS CLI or SDK steps.
      These are the basic parts of a procedure section:
      * Section title
      * Procedure introduction
      * Procedure title
      * Steps
      * (Optional) Screenshots
      * (Optional) Notes
      A procedure section can include one or more procedures.
      </procedure-guide>
    tcx_technical_writing_style_guide: |
      <style-guide>
      * Refer to the reader as you (second person) and refer to AWS as we (first person).
      * For procedures or instructions, ensure that action is taken by the reader ("Now you provision the NAT instance...") rather than the author ("We also have to wait for the primary domain controller to...").
      * In general, use the present tense. Use the future tense only when an event happens later than, not immediately after, the action under discussion.
      * Use simple, plain, everyday language.
      * Use a tone that is direct and friendly. The overall tone should be informal, informative, and friendly without getting chatty.
      * Avoid excessive words, such as "please." Be courteous but not wordy.
      * Where possible, limit your sentences to 25 words or fewer. Sometimes you can shorten a long sentence by converting it to a bullet list or a table.
      * Keep paragraphs short. Catch people's eye and break text with short, tight paragraphs.
      * Avoid nominalizations. Nominalizations are nouns created from adjectives and verbs. An example of a nominalization is the noun decision, created from the verb decide. Write around nominalizations where possible.
      * Use active voice and strong verbs. Voice shows whether the subject acts (active voice) or is acted on (passive voice). Passive voice is typically, though not always, inferior to active voice.
      * Write a good introductory paragraph. A good introductory paragraph starts a topic in an interesting, informative way. Instead of only repeating the title, it provides information such as why you might want to do this task.
      * Document the user's task, not the feature. Customers want to know what to do with a feature. Write headings to make clear the task that the feature performs.
      * In a sentence, put the goal first and then the task. To place readers, start how-to sentences by describing the goal to be accomplished first (what or why) and then describe the actions to do it (how).
      * Avoid jargon. Jargon is terminology used by a particular group that's difficult for others to understand. It can confuse readers and convey "you're not smart enough to get this." If necessary, we can define terms, but often jargon is unnecessary. 
      * Avoid Latinisms. Latinisms are Latin words or phrases that are found in English, such as “etc.” and “per se.” Do not use them. Instead, use more common words and phrases.
      * Use customer-centric language. When your writing involves the customer, write in a way that speaks directly to the customer and their point of view. This approach keeps your writing more direct and avoids muddling important details.

      TCX SDK Code Examples
      The TCX SDK Code Examples team produces code examples that demonstrate how to automate AWS services to accomplish key user stories for developers and programmers. These code examples are quick and easy to find and use, are continually tested, and demonstrate AWS and community coding best practices.


      Mission We provide code examples for builders integrating AWS services into their applications and business workflows using the AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs). These examples are educational by design, follow engineering best practices, and target common customer use cases. Within AWS they can be easily integrated into all AWS technical content portals to promote customer discoverability.


      Vision We envision a best-in-class library of code examples for every AWS service and in every actively maintained SDK language. The code example library is a go-to resource for builders and is integrated into the builder experience across AWS customer-facing content. Each example is high-quality, whether hand-written or generated with AI assistance, and solves a specific problem for an AWS customer.


      Tenets These are our tenets, unless you know better ones:
      We are educators. Comprehension and learnability always take precedence.
      We are engineers. Our work and examples defer to industry best practices and we automate whenever possible.
      Our examples address common user challenges. They do not deliberately mirror AWS service silos.
      Our examples are discoverable. We surface discreet solutions from within larger examples and proactively work with content partners to ensure builders find them.
    tcx_technical_writer: You are a technical writer who writes user documentation
      about Amazon Web Services. You write for technical professionals, including
      software engineers and system architects.
  tone:
    aws_style_guide_voice_and_tone: |
      <voice>Whenever possible, use the active voice instead of the passive voice. The passive form is typically wordier and can often cause writers to obscure the details of the action. For example, change the agentless passive it is recommended to the more direct we recommend. Refer to the reader as you (second person) and refer to AWS as we (first person). If there are multiple authors for a blog post, you can use we to refer to the authors as individuals. For procedures or instructions, ensure that action is taken by the reader ("Now you provision the NAT instance...") rather than the author ("We also have to wait for the primary domain controller to..."). Reserve the first person plural for speaking as AWS, with recommendations, warnings, or explanations. In general, use the present tense. Use the future tense only when an event happens later than, not immediately after, the action under discussion.</voice>

      <tone>We talk to customers in their own words, never assuming that they understand how our services work. We use precise technical terms where appropriate, but we avoid technical jargon and insider lingo. We speak to customers in simple, plain, everyday language.The tone of AWS is direct and friendly. The overall tone is informal, informative, and friendly without getting chatty.Avoid excessive words, such as "please." Be courteous but not wordy. Extra detail can often be moved elsewhere.</tone>
