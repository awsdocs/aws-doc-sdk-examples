# Deployment Instructions

There are two ways to deploy the code in this directory.

## 1. Using the deploy script

To deploy any stack in this directory, run the [deploy.py](stacks/deploy.py) script.

### Script Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 installed
- `ada` or equivalent CLI library for fetching AWS credentials.
- Dependencies installed in Python virtual environment:

```
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- AWS CLI and CDK installed and configured (NodeJS 18+)
- Permissions to execute AWS CDK and shell commands (`AdministratorAccess` will work for non-production test environments)
- Configuration files `resources.yaml` and `targets.yaml`, which exist in the [stacks/config](stacks/config) directory within the same directory as the script

### Usage

#### Command Syntax

```bash
cd stacks ; python deploy.py <stack>
```

Replace `<stack>` with one of the supported stacks:

- `admin`: Deploys admin-specific resources.
- `images`: Deploys image-related resources.
- `plugin`: Deploys plugin-specific resources.
  - To deploy only a specific language's plugin, pass `--language <language>` where language is an account in [targets.yaml](stacks/config/targets.yaml).

#### Additional Notes

The script automatically navigates to the required directory based on the type and language of deployment (typescript is the default).

Environment variables are set and used during the deployment process.

Errors during command execution are caught and displayed.

The script includes a sleep period after deployment to avoid conflicts with simultaneous CDK operations.

Make sure to check the script's output for any errors or confirmation messages that indicate the deployment's success or failure. Adjust the config files as necessary to match your deployment requirements.

## 2. Invoking CDK directly

The second option involves navigating to each stack directory and running the CDK commands.

The following instructions assume a "plugin account" (the AWS account where testing activities will occur) of "python" (corresponding to a Docker image) per [this repository's configuration](config/targets.yaml).
You can replace Python with any of the other languages listed in this repository's configuration.

To request an alternate configuration for your own repository or use case, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/issues/new?labels=type%2Fenhancement&labels=Tools&title=%5BEnhancement%5D%3A+Weathertop+Customization+Request&&) with the `Tools` label.

### 1. Deploy Plugin Stack for your language (e.g. Python)

User will:

1. Set Python virtualenv within [plugin directory](plugin/admin).
1. `export LANGUAGE_NAME=python`.
1. Get AWS account tokens for plugin account.
1. `cdk bootstrap` and `cdk deploy`.

### 2. Enable Consumer Stack to receive event notifications

User will:

1. Set `status` to `enabled` in [targets.yaml](config/targets.yaml) for your language
1. Raise PR.

Admin will:

1. Approve and merge PR.
1. Set Python virtualenv within [admin directory](stacks/admin).
1. Get Admin account tokens.
1. `cdk bootstrap` and `cdk deploy`.
1. Request that user [submit a test job](#3-submit-test-job).

### 3. Submit test job

User will:

1. Log into console for Python account
1. Navigate to "Job Definitions".

1. Click "Next".

1. Click "Create job".
   ![](docs/validation-flow-5.jpg)
1. [Validate results of test job](#3-optional-view-test-job-results)

### 3. Optional: View CloudWatch job results in Batch

1. Navigate to a job
1. When status is `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED`, click "Logging" tab.
