# Code Generation Orchestration

## Purpose
Define location of relevant steering docs that are outside of the .kiro directory. Refer to all steering docs in the ./steering_docs directory. Use the appropriate steering instructions for the requested language. Use the directories given below.

- .NET: dotnet-tech
- Java: java-tech
- Kotlin: kotlin-tech

## Code Generation
When a specification file is provided by the user, use that specification directly. Do not create your own spec or task breakdown. Follow the provided specification exactly and implement the requirements as described.

If no specification is provided, then do not use separate steps for planning and tasks unless specifically asked to do so. Perform the tasks without stopping for user input.
