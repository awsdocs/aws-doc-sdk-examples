#  Amazon Pinpoint SMS and Voice API JavaScript SDK v2 code examples
## Purpose
This is a workspace where you can find examples for the Amazon Pinpoint SMS and Voice API using AWS SDK for JavaScript version 2 (v2).

Amazon Pinpoint is a flexible and scalable outbound and inbound marketing communications service. You can connect with customers over channels like email, SMS, push, or voice.
## Code examples
### API examples
- [Send a voice message](./pinpoint_send_voice_message_sms_voice_api.js)

## Important
- As an AWS best practice, grant this code least privilege, or only the
  permissions required to perform a task. For more information, see
  [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege)
  in the *AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide*.
- This code has not been tested in all AWS Regions. Some AWS services are
  available only in specific AWS Regions. For more information, see the
  [AWS Regional Services List](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/)
  on the AWS website.
- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.

## Running the code

### Prerequisites
- An AWS account. To create an account, see [How do I create and activate a new AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/) on the AWS Premium Support website.
- AWS credentials. For details, see  [Setting credentials in Node.js](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html) in the
  *AWS SDK for Javascript (v2) Developer Guide*.
- The AWS SDK for JavaScript (v2). For AWS SDK for JavaScript download and installation instructions, see
  [Installing the AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/installing-jssdk.html) in the
  *AWS SDK for JavaScript (v2) Developer Guide*.

Most of these code example files can be run with very little to no modification. For example, to use Node.js
to run the `pinpoint_send_voice_message_sms_voice_api.js` file, replace the hard-coded values in the file with your own values, save the file, and then run the file. For example:

```
node pinpoint_send_voice_message_sms_voice_api.js
```
