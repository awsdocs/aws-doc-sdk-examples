# Amazon Cloudwatch Logs JavaScript SDK v2 code examples
## Purpose
The code examples in this directory demonstrate how to work with Amazon CloudWatch Logs
using the AWS SDK for JavaScript v2.

You can use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor, store, and access your log files from Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, AWS CloudTrail, Route 53, and other sources.

## Code examples
### API examples
- [Delete a CloudWatch log subscription filters](./cwl_deletesubscriptionfilter.js)
- [Describe CloudWatch log subscription filters](./cwl_describesubscriptionfilters.js)
- [Put a CloudWatch log subscription filter](./cwl_putsubscriptionfilter.js)


## Important

- As an AWS best practice, grant this code least privilege, or only the
  permissions required to perform a task. For more information, see
  [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege)
  in the *AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide*.
- This code has not been tested in all AWS Regions. Some AWS services are
  available only in specific AWS Regions. For more information, see the
  [AWS Regional Services List](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/)
  on the AWS website.
- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.

## Running the code

### Prerequisites
- An AWS account. To create an account, see [How do I create and activate a new AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/) on the AWS Premium Support website.
- AWS credentials. For details, see  [Setting credentials in Node.js](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html) in the
  *AWS SDK for Javascript (v2) Developer Guide*.
- The AWS SDK for JavaScript (v2). For AWS SDK for JavaScript download and installation instructions, see
  [Installing the AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/installing-jssdk.html) in the
  *AWS SDK for JavaScript (v2) Developer Guide*.

Most of these code example files can be run with very little to no modification. For example, to use Node.js to run
the `cwl_deletesubscriptionfilter.rb` file, replace the hard-coded values in the file with your own values, save the file, and then run the file. For example:

```
node cwl_deletesubscriptionfilter.js
```
