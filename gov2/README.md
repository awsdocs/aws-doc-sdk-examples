# SDK for Go V2 code examples

## Overview

The code examples in this topic show you how to use the AWS SDK for Go V2 with AWS.

The SDK for Go V2 provides a Go API for AWS infrastructure services. Using the
SDK, you can build applications on top of Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, Amazon DynamoDB,
and more.

## Types of code examples

* **Single-service actions** - Code examples that show you how to call individual
  service functions.

* **Single-service scenarios** - Code examples that show you how to accomplish a
  specific task by calling multiple functions within the same service.

* **Cross-service examples** - Sample applications that work across multiple AWS
  services.

### Finding code examples

Single-service actions and scenarios are organized by AWS service.
A README in each folder lists and describes how to run the examples.

Cross-service examples are located in the [cross_service](cross_service) folder.
A README in each folder describes how to run the example.

## ⚠️ Important

* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.
* Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.
* We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the
  minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see
  [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege).
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information,
  see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

### Prerequisites

* You must have an AWS account, and have your default credentials and AWS Region
  configured as described in the
  [AWS Tools and SDKs Shared Configuration and Credentials Reference Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/creds-config-files.html).
* [Go 1.18 or later](https://go.dev/doc/install)

### Run the code

Each example is a Go module that typically contains two packages that you can run:
`hello` and `cmd`. The `hello` package makes a single call to a service to verify that you
can use the service with the SDK. The `cmd` package runs more complex scenarios
to show you how to accomplish specific tasks.

For example, run the `hello` package from the command line:

```
go run ./hello
```

Some examples require command line arguments. In these cases, you can run the example
with a `-h` flag to get help. Each example has a README.md that describes additional
specifics about how to run the example and any other prerequisites.

## Tests

All tests use go test, and you can find them alongside the code in the folder for each
example. When an example has additional requirements to run tests, you can find them
in the README for that service or cross-service example.

### Unit tests

The unit tests in this module use stubbed responses from [AwsmStubber](testtools/awsm_stubber.go).
AwsmStubber is a tool that uses the AWS SDK for Go middleware to intercept calls to
AWS, verify inputs, and return a mocked response. This means that when the unit tests
are run, requests are not sent to AWS and no charges are incurred on your account.

Run unit tests in the folder for each service or cross-service example at a command
prompt.

```
go test ./...
```

### Integration tests

⚠️ Running the integration tests might result in charges to your AWS account.

The integration tests in this module make actual requests to AWS. This means that when
the integration tests are run, they can create and destroy resources in your account.
These tests might also incur charges. Proceed with caution.

Run integration tests in the folder for each service or cross-service example at a
command prompt by including the `integration` tag.

```
go test -tags=integration ./...
```

## Docker image (Beta)

This example code will soon be available in a container image
hosted on [Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/what-is-ecr.html).
The image will be preloaded with all Go examples, with dependencies pre-resolved.
That way, you can explore the examples in an isolated environment.

⚠️ As of January 2023, the [SDK for Go V2 image](https://gallery.ecr.aws/b4v4v1s0/gov2) is available in the Amazon ECR Public Gallery but is still undergoing active development. Refer to [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/issues/4125)
for more information.

### Build the Docker image

1. Install and run Docker on your machine.
2. Navigate to the same directory as this README.
3. Run `docker build -t <image_name> .` and replace `image_name` with a name for the image.

### Launch the Docker container

Run the Docker container with your image using the following command:

**Windows**

```
docker run -it --volume %USERPROFILE%\.aws:/root/.aws <image_name>
```

**macOS or Linux**
```
docker run -it -v ~/.aws/credentials:/root/.aws/credentials <image_name>
```

The terminal initiates a bash instance at the root of the container.
The Go code examples are in the `gov2` folder and can be run by following
the instructions in the READMEs in the various folders.

### Run tests in the Docker container

To run all unit tests and write the output to a file, run the following command
in the `gov2` directory of the container:

```
./run_all_tests.sh
```

To run integration tests, pass an `integration` argument to the `run_all_tests.sh`
script. Integration tests create and destroy AWS resources and will incur charges on your account.
Proceed with caution.
