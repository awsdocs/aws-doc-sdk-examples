_Amazon SNS is a web service that enables applications, end-users, and devices to instantly send and receive notifications from the cloud._

## ⚠ Important

* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account. For more details, see [AWS Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) and [Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/).
* Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.
* We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege).
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

## Code examples

### Prerequisites

For prerequisites, see the [README](../README.md#Prerequisites) in the `gov2` folder.


<!--custom.prerequisites.start-->
<!--custom.prerequisites.end-->

### Get started

- [Hello Amazon SNS](hello/hello.go#L4) (`ListTopics`)


### Single actions

Code excerpts that show you how to call individual service functions.

- [CreateTopic](../workflows/topics_and_queues/actions/sns_actions.go#L27)
- [DeleteTopic](../workflows/topics_and_queues/actions/sns_actions.go#L56)
- [ListTopics](hello/hello.go#L4)
- [Publish](../workflows/topics_and_queues/actions/sns_actions.go#L105)
- [Subscribe](../workflows/topics_and_queues/actions/sns_actions.go#L70)

### Scenarios

Code examples that show you how to accomplish a specific task by calling multiple
functions within the same service.

- [Publish messages to queues](../workflows/topics_and_queues/workflows/scenario_topics_and_queues.go)


<!--custom.examples.start-->
### Workflows

Examples that show you how to complete a specific task.

#### [Publish messages to queues](../workflows/topics_and_queues/workflows/scenario_topics_and_queues.go)

This example shows you how to do the following:

- Create topic (FIFO or non-FIFO).
- Subscribe several queues to the topic with an option to apply a filter.
- Publish messages to the topic.
- Poll the queues for messages received.

The code for this example is in the `gov2/workflows/topics_and_queues` folder.
Instructions for how to run are in the [README](../workflows/topics_and_queues/README.md) in the same folder.

```

#### Run a scenario

All scenarios can be run with the `cmd` runner. To get a list of scenarios
and to get help for running a scenario, use the following command:

```
go run ./cmd -h
```

#### Publish messages to queues

This example shows you how to do the following:

- Create topic (FIFO or non-FIFO).
- Subscribe several queues to the topic with an option to apply a filter.
- Publish messages to the topic.
- Poll the queues for messages received.
