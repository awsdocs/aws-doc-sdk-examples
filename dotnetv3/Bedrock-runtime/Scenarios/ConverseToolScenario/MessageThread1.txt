  Team,
  
  Just checking in on the status of the Q1 project deliverables. We're coming up on the deadline in the next couple weeks and I want to make sure we're all on track.
  
  Can you each provide a quick update on where you're at with your assigned tasks? 
  
  Thanks,
  Tim

  Hi Tim,
  
  I'm making good progress on the data migration piece. I've completed the ETL scripts and they're currently running in our test environment. I'm planning to push the changes to production this Friday.
  
  Let me know if you need anything else from me.
  
  Regards,
  Jane

  Hi Tim,
  
  I'm a little behind on the API development. I hit a roadblock with an integration issue that's taking me longer than expected to resolve. I'm hoping to have the core functionality completed by next Monday, but the UI work may slip into the following week.
  
  Please let me know if you have any concerns about the timeline.
  
  Thanks,
  David

  Thanks Jane and David for the updates.
  
  David, I understand these things can sometimes take longer than expected. As long as we can get the core functionality done by next Monday, I think we should be okay. Please keep me posted on your progress.
  
  Let me know if there's anything I can do to help unblock you.

  Tim, I'd be happy to lend a hand with the API work if that would be helpful. Just let me know.

  Thanks Jane, I may take you up on that offer if David needs some extra help. I'll let you know.
