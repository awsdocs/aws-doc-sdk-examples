# Bedrock Runtime Converse API with Tool Feature Scenario

## Overview

This example shows how to use AWS SDKs and the Amazon Bedrock Converse API to call a custom tool from a large language model (LLM) as part of a multistep conversation. The example creates a weather tool that leverages the Open-Meteo API to retrieve current weather information based on user input.

## âš  Important

* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.
* Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.
* We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege).
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

## Scenario

This example illustrates a typical interaction between a generative AI model, an application, and connected tools or APIs to solve a problem or achieve a specific goal. The scenario follows these steps:

1. Set up the system prompt and tool configuration. 
2. Specify the AI model to be used (e.g., Anthropic Claude 3 Sonnet). 
3. Create a client to interact with Amazon Bedrock. 
4. Prompt the user for their weather request. 
5. Send the user input including the conversation history to the model.
6. The model processes the input and determines if a connected tool or API needs to be used. If this is the case, the model returns a tool use request with specific parameters needed to invoke the tool, and a unique tool use ID to correlate tool responses to the request.
7. The scenario application invokes the tool to fetch weather data, and append the response and tool use ID to the conversation.
8. The model uses the tool response to generate a final response. If additional tool requests are needed, the process is repeated.
9. Once the final response is received and printed, the application returns to the prompt.

### Prerequisites

For general prerequisites, see the [README](../../../README.md) in the `dotnetv3` folder.

### Resources

No additional resources are needed for this scenario.

### Instructions

After the example compiles, you can run it from the command line. To do so, navigate to
the folder that contains the .sln file and run the following command:

```
dotnet run
```

Alternatively, you can run the example from within your IDE.

This starts an interactive scenario that walks you through exploring conditional requests for read, write, and copy operations.
