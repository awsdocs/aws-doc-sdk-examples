Team,

I'd like to schedule a meeting to review the status of our Q1 project deliverables. Can we find a time that works for everyone's schedule?

Some potential options:
- Thursday, 3/9 at 2pm
- Friday, 3/10 at 10am
- Monday, 3/13 at 1pm

Please let me know your availability and preference. I'd like to have this meeting before the end of next week if possible.

Thanks,
Tina

Hi Tina,

The 3/10 at 10am time works best for me. Let me know if that works for the rest of the team.

Thanks,
Mei

The 3/10 at 10am time works for me as well. That should give us enough time before the end of the week.
