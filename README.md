# AWS SDK Code Examples

This repository contains code examples that demonstrate how to use the [AWS SDKs](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/tools/) to interact with [AWS services](https://aws.amazon.com/products).

Many examples are injected into the [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com).

## How this repository is organized

Code examples for each language's SDK can be found within the following subdirectories. The examples here demonstrate the most common uses of the SDK for each language.

|     SDK    |       folder      | SDK version |
|:----------:|:-----------------:|:-----------:|
| .NET       | [dotnetv3/](dotnetv3)         | 3.5+        |
| .NET       | [dotnet/](.dotnet)           | <3.5        |
| C++        | [cpp/](cpp)              | 1           |
| Go         | [gov2/](gov2)            | 2           |
| Go         | [go/](go)               | 1           |
| Java       | [javav2/](javav2)           | 2           |
| Java       | [java/](java)             | 1           |
| JavaScript | [javascriptv3/](javascriptv3)     | 3           |
| JavaScript | [javascript/](javascriptv)       | 2           |
| Kotlin     | [kotlin/](kotlin)           | 1             |
| PHP        | [php/](php)              | 3           |
| Python     | [python/](python)           | 3           |
| Ruby       | [ruby/](ruby)             | 3           |
| Rust       | [rustv1/](rustv1) | 1             |
| Swift      | [swift/](swift)            | preview           |

Within each directory, you will find SDK-specific instructions for understanding and invoking example code.

### NOTE
In alignment with our SDKs and Tools Maintenance Policy, the AWS SDK for Java v1.x will enter maintenance mode on July 31, 2024, and reach end-of-support on December 31, 2025.
