## Working with issues

We use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/features/issues) to organize all significant work. Any external contributions will
first take the form of issues.

### Existing issues
Briefly review [all open issues](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/issues) for the following reasons:
* Search for contribution opportunities
* Verify that your contribution idea is not already in progress

### Create an issue (~5 min)
To create a new issue, use the following two (2) templates:
* [Bug report](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/issues/new?assignees=octocat&labels=type%2Fbug&template=bug.yaml&title=%5BBug%5D%3A+%3CDESCRIPTIVE+TITLE+HERE%3E)
* [Feature request](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/issues/new?assignees=octocat&labels=type%2Fenhancement&template=enhancement.yaml&title=%5BEnhancement%5D%3A+%3CDESCRIPTIVE+TITLE+HERE%3E)

All contributions that are not bug fixes must be pre-approved by the maintainers.

### Close an issue
At any time, you can close issues that you create yourself.

## Authoring code
Follow these steps when you are ready to begin writing code:
1. [Fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).
2. Modify your fork using the CLI or [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow).
3. When your fork contains your finished and tested code, [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/).

#### Exception for minor bug fixes
For single-line bug fixes, you can optionally [edit the file directly on the Github website](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files)
without needing to create a fork.

## Best practices for coding
1. Follow [coding best practices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_best_practices) such 
as [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) and [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) where possible.
2. Carefully read the pull request template and follow it closely.
3. Don't include AWS account identifiers or secret keys in your examples.
