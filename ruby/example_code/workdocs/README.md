# WorkDocs code examples for the SDK for Ruby
## Overview
These examples show how to create and manage Amazon WorkDocs resources using the SDK for Ruby.

WorkDocs is a fully managed, secure enterprise storage and sharing service with strong administrative controls and feedback capabilities that improve user productivity.

## ⚠️ Important
* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account. 
* Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.
* We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege). 
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

## Code examples

### Single actions
Code excerpts that show you how to call individual service functions.

* [List a user's documents](./wd_list_user_docs.rb) (`GetDocuments`)

* [List users](./wd_list_users.rb) (`DescribeUsers`)






## Run the examples

### Prerequisites

See the [Ruby README.md](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/ruby/README.md) for prerequisites.

### Instructions
The easiest way to interact with this example code is by invoking [Single Actions](#single-actions) from your command line. This may require some modification to override hard-coded values, and some actions also expect runtime parameters. For example, `ruby some_action.rb ARG1 ARG2` will invoke `some_action.rb` with two arguments.
