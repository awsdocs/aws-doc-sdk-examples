# KMS code examples for the SDK for Ruby
## Overview
These examples show how to create and manage AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys using the SDK for Ruby.

KMS is an encryption and key management service scaled for the cloud.

## ⚠️ Important
* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account. 
* Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.
* We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege). 
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

## Code examples

### Single actions
Code excerpts that show you how to call individual service functions.

* [Create a key](./create_key.rb) (`CreateKey`)

* [Decrypt a blob](./decrypt_data.rb) (`Decrypt`)

* [Encrypt data](./encrypt_data.rb) (`Encrypt`)

* [Re-encrypt data](./re_encrypt_data.rb) (`ReEncrypt`)






## Run the examples

### Prerequisites

See the [Ruby README.md(https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/ruby/README.md) for pre-requisites.

### Instructions
The easiest way to interact with this example code is by invoking individual [Actions](#Actions) from your command line. This may require some modification to override hard-coded values, and some actions also expect runtime parameters. For example, `ruby some_action.rb ARG1 ARG2` will invoke `some_action.rb` with two arguments.
