# ElasticTranscoder code examples for the SDK for Ruby
## Overview
These examples show how to create and manage Amazon Elastic Transcoder workflows using the SDK for Ruby.

ElasticTranscoder lets you convert media files that you have stored in Amazon S3 into media files in the formats required by consumer playback devices.

## ⚠️ Important
* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account. 
* Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.
* We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege). 
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

## Code examples

### Single actions
Code excerpts that show you how to call individual service functions.

* [Create a job](./create_job.rb) (`CreateJob)



### Scenarios
Code examples that show you how to accomplish a specific task by calling multiple functions within the same service.

* [Configure a new pipeline and job with SQS notifications](./create_job_status_notification.rb)
