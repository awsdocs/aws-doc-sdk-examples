# Purpose
# This code example demonstrates how to upload an encrypted object to an
# Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket.

# snippet-start:[s3.ruby.s3_add_csaes_encrypt_item]

require 'aws-sdk-s3'
require 'openssl'

# Prerequisites:
#
# - An Amazon S3 bucket.
#
# @param s3_encryption_client [Aws::S3::EncryptionV2::Client]
#   An initialized Amazon S3 V2 encryption client.
# @param bucket_name [String] The name of the bucket.
# @param object_key [String] The name of the object to upload.
# @param object_content [String] The content of the object to upload.
# @return [Boolean] true if the object was encrypted and uploaded;
#   otherwise, false.
# @example
#   s3_encryption_client = Aws::S3::EncryptionV2::Client.new(
#     region: 'us-west-2',
#     encryption_key: get_random_aes_256_gcm_key, # See later in this file.
#     key_wrap_schema: :aes_gcm,
#     content_encryption_schema: :aes_gcm_no_padding,
#     security_profile: :v2
#   )
#   if encrypted_object_uploaded?(
#     s3_encryption_client,
#     'amzn-s3-demo-bucket',
#     'my-file.txt',
#     'This is the content of my-file.txt.'
#   )
#     puts 'Uploaded.'
#   else
#     puts 'Not uploaded.'

# Generates a random AES256-GCM key. Call this function if you do not
#   already have an AES256-GCM key that you want to use to encrypt the
#   object.
#
# @ return [String] The generated AES256-GCM key. You must keep a record of
#   the key string that is reported. You will not be able to later decrypt the
#   contents of any object that is encrypted with this key unless you
#   have this key.
# @ example
#     get_random_aes_256_gcm_key
