# Purpose
#
# Shows how to put an object in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket and
# encrypt the file server-side by using the 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256)
# block cipher.

# snippet-start:[s3.ruby.s3_encrypt_file_upload.rb]

# Wraps Amazon S3 object actions.

  attr_reader :object

  # @param object [Aws::S3::Object] An existing Amazon S3 object.
  def initialize(object)
    @object = object
  end
