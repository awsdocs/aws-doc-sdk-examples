# Running a CDK app<a name="cdk"></a>

This section describes how to run any of these AWS CDK apps in this directory.

Inputs (replace in code):
- CLOUDFORMATION_TEMPLATE_NAME (For example, 'setup.yaml'.)
- STACK_NAME (For example, 'myDynamoDBStack')

 You can run a CDK app in several ways:

 1. To run this app with the AWS CDK, run the following command:

    npm install && cdk synth && cdk deploy

The AWS CDK app displays the names of the resources it creates in the output.

To destroy the generated AWS resources after you are finished using them, run the following command:

    cdk destroy

 **Note**: In some cases, such as when an Amazon S3 bucket is not empty, the AWS CDK app cannot destroy a resource.


 2. To run this app with the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI):


    a. Run the following command to create an AWS CloudFormation template:

       npm install && cdk synth >CLOUDFORMATION_TEMPLATE_NAME

    b. Run the following command to create a stack
       based on this AWS CloudFormation template. This stack
       will create the specified AWS resources.

       aws cloudformation create-stack --template-body file: CLOUDFORMATION_TEMPLATE_NAME --stack-name STACK_NAME

    c. To display the names of the generated resources, run the
       following command:

       aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name STACK_NAME --query Stacks[0].Outputs --output text

       Note that the generated resources might not be immediately available.
       You can keep running this command until you see their names.

    d. To destroy the generated AWS resources after you are finished using them,
       run the following command:

       aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name STACK_NAME

 **Note**: In some cases, such as when an Amazon S3 bucket is not empty, the AWS CDK app cannot destroy a resource.

 3. To run this app with the AWS CloudFormation console:

    a. Run the following command to create an AWS CloudFormation template:

       npm install && cdk synth > CLOUDFORMATION_TEMPLATE_NAME
    b. Sign in to the AWS CloudFormation console, at:

       https:console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation

    d. Choose Create stack, and then follow
       the on-screen instructions to create a stack based on this
       AWS CloudFormation template. This stack will create the specified
       AWS resources.

       The names of the generated resources will display on the stack's
       Outputs tab in the console after the stack's status displays as
       CREATE_COMPLETE.

    e. To destroy the generated AWS resources after you are finished using them,
       choose the stack in the console, choose Delete, and then follow
       the on-screen instructions.

 **Note**: In some cases, such as when an Amazon S3 bucket is not empty, the AWS CDK app cannot destroy a resource.
