# Amazon Redshift item tracker sample application resources

## Overview

Creates AWS resources for Amazon Redshift sample applications. The scripts in this
example create the following resources:
 
* An AWS Secrets Manager secret that contains administrator credentials in a format 
that can be used by an Amazon Redshift database. 
* A Redshift cluster and database configured to use the credentials from the secret.

## ⚠️ Important

* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account. 
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

## Deploying resources

You can use the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) or the AWS Command Line Interface
(AWS CLI) to deploy and destroy the resources for this example.

### Deploying with the AWS CDK

To deploy with the AWS CDK, you must install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and the 
[AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html).

This example was built and tested with AWS CDK 2.33.0.

Deploy AWS resources by running the following at a command prompt in the
`resources/cdk/redshift_item_tracker` folder:

```
npm install
cdk deploy
```

The stack takes a few minutes to deploy. When it completes, it prints output like 
the following:

```
Outputs:
RedshiftItemTrackerStack.ClusterId = doc-example-work-items-cluster
RedshiftItemTrackerStack.Database = workitemtracker
RedshiftItemTrackerStack.SecretArn = arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:0123456789012:secret:docexampleredshiftworkitems-QlmFqEXAMPLE-nsoAF0
```

### Deploying with the AWS CLI 

To deploy with the AWS CLI you must first install the 
[AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).

1. Deploy AWS resources by running the following at a command prompt in the 
    `resources/cdk/redshift_item_tracker` folder:
    
    ```
    aws cloudformation create-stack --template-body file://redshift_item_tracker.yaml --stack-name YOUR_STACK_NAME
    ```
    
    *Note:* The stack name must be unique within an AWS Region and AWS account. You can 
    specify up to 128 characters, and numbers and hyphens are allowed.

2. The stack takes a few minutes to deploy. You can check status by running the following:

    ```
    aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name YOUR_STACK_NAME
    ```
    
    When the stack is ready, it shows `StackStatus` of `CREATE_COMPLETE`.

3. You can get the outputs from the stack by running the following:

    ```
    aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name STACK_NAME --query Stacks[0].Outputs --output text
    ```
    
    This results in output like the following: 
    
    ```
    ClusterId = doc-example-work-items-cluster
    Database = workitemtracker
    SecretArn = arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:0123456789012:secret:docexampleredshiftworkitems-QlmFqEXAMPLE-nsoAF0
    ```

## Using the resources

After the database and secret are created, you can use the AWS Management Console,
AWS CLI, or an AWS SDK to run SQL commands to create tables and manage data in the 
Redshift database.

For example, use the AWS CLI to run a statement with the Redshift Data API Service to 
create a table in the Redshift database. 
Replace the `secret-arn` value with the value that was output when you deployed the 
resource stack.

```
aws redshift-data execute-statement ^
    --cluster-identifier "doc-example-work-items-cluster" ^
    --database "workitemtracker" ^
    --secret-arn "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:0123456789012:secret:docexampleredshiftworkitems-QlmFqEXAMPLE-nsoAF0" ^
    --sql "create table work_items (work_item_id INT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY ( 1, 1 ) PRIMARY KEY, created_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, description TEXT, guide TEXT, status TEXT, username VARCHAR(45), archive BOOL DEFAULT 0);"
```

You can insert a row into the `work_items` table by substituting SQL like the following:

```
    --sql "insert into work_items (description, guide, status, username) values ('My first work item', 'My guide', 'Not started', 'myuser');"
```

Or get all data from the `work_items` table:

```
    --sql "select * FROM work_items;"
```

Instead of returning the result of the SELECT statement, this command returns data
about the statement, including the statement ID:

```
"Id": "cexample-bc7e-409d-9095-39540EXAMPLE"
``` 

To get the records returned from the SELECT statement, call `get-statement-result` and
pass it the statement ID returned from the `execute-statement` command:

```
aws redshift-data get-statement-result --id "cexample-bc7e-409d-9095-39540EXAMPLE"
```

## Destroying resources

### Destroying with the AWS CDK

You can use the AWS CDK to destroy the resources by running the following:

```
cdk destroy
```

### Destroying with the AWS CLI

You can use the AWS CLI to destroy the resources by running the following:

```
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name YOUR_STACK_NAME
```
