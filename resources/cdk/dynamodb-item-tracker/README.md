# DynamoDB item tracker resources

## Overview

Creates the following AWS resources for Amazon DynamoDB item tracker sample applications:

* A DynamoDB table that has a string partition key named `iditem`.

## ⚠️ Important

* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

## Deploy resources

You can use the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) or the AWS Command Line Interface
(AWS CLI) to deploy and destroy the resources for this example.

### Deploy with the AWS CDK

To deploy with the AWS CDK, you must install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and the
[AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html).

This example was built and tested with AWS CDK 2.33.0.

Deploy AWS resources by running the following at a command prompt in this README's folder:

```
npm install
cdk deploy
```

The stack takes a few minutes to deploy. When it completes, it prints output like
the following:

```
Outputs:
doc-example-work-item-tracker-stack.TableName = doc-example-work-item-tracker
```

### Deploy with the AWS CLI

To deploy with the AWS CLI, you must first install the
[AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).

1. Deploy AWS resources by running the following at a command prompt in this README's folder:

    ```
    aws cloudformation create-stack --template-body file://setup.yaml --stack-name YOUR_STACK_NAME
    ```

    *Note:* The stack name must be unique within an AWS Region and AWS account. You can
    specify up to 128 characters, and numbers and hyphens are allowed.

2. The stack takes a few minutes to deploy. You can check status by running the following:

    ```
    aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name YOUR_STACK_NAME
    ```

    When the stack is ready, it shows `StackStatus` of `CREATE_COMPLETE`.

3. You can get the outputs from the stack by running the following:

    ```
    aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name STACK_NAME --query Stacks[0].Outputs --output text
    ```

    This results in output like the following:

    ```
    TableName = doc-example-work-item-tracker
    ```

## Destroy resources

### Destroy with the AWS CDK

You can use the AWS CDK to destroy the resources by running the following:

```
cdk destroy
```

### Destroy with the AWS CLI

You can use the AWS CLI to destroy the resources by running the following:

```
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name YOUR_STACK_NAME
```
