# SES v2 Coupon Newsletter Workflow Specification

Use the Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) v2 API to manage a subscription list for a weekly newsletter.

## Prepare the Application

1. Create an email identity.
   - Request a `verified email` address from the user. This will be used as the `from` address, and the user will need to click a verification link in their email before continuing to part 3.
   - Operation: **CreateEmailIdentity**
     - Parameters:
       - `EmailIdentity`: Value of the `verified email` given by the user.
     - Errors:
       - `AlreadyExistsException`: If the identity already exists, skip this step and proceed with the next operation. This error can be safely ignored.
       - `NotFoundException`: If the identity does not exist, fail the workflow and inform the user that the provided email address is not verified.
       - `LimitExceededException`: If the limit for email identities is exceeded, fail the workflow and inform the user that they have reached the limit for email identities.
2. Create a contact list with the name `weekly-coupons-newsletter`.
   - Operation: **CreateContactList**
     - Parameters:
       - `ContactListName`: `weekly-coupons-newsletter`
     - Errors:
       - `AlreadyExistsException`: If the contact list already exists, skip this step and proceed with the next operation. This error can be safely ignored.
       - `LimitExceededException`: If the limit for contact lists is exceeded, fail the workflow and inform the user that they have reached the limit for contact lists.
3. Create an email template named `weekly-coupons` with the following content:
   - Subject: `Weekly Coupons Newsletter`
   - HTML Content: Available in the `coupon-newsletter.html` file.
   - Text Content: Available in the `coupon-newsletter.txt` file.
   - The emails should include an [Unsubscribe](#) link, using the url `{{amazonSESUnsubscribeUrl}}`.
   - Operation: **CreateEmailTemplate**
     - Parameters:
       - `TemplateName`: `weekly-coupons`
       - `TemplateContent`:
         - `Subject`: `Weekly Coupons Newsletter`
         - `Html`: Read from the `coupon-newsletter.html` file
         - `Text`: Read from the `coupon-newsletter.txt` file
     - Errors:
       - `AlreadyExistsException`: If the template already exists, skip this step and proceed with the next operation. This error can be safely ignored.
       - `LimitExceededException`: If the limit for email templates is exceeded, fail the workflow and inform the user that they have reached the limit for email templates.

## Gather Subscriber Email Addresses

1. Prompt the user to enter a base email address for subscribing to the newsletter.
   - For testing purposes, this workflow uses a single email address with [subaddress extensions](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5233.html) (e.g., `user+ses-weekly-newsletter-1@example.com`, `user+ses-weekly-newsletter-2@example.com`, etc., also known as [plus addressing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20the%20address%20joeuser,sorting%2C%20and%20for%20spam%20control.)).
   - Create 3 variants of this email address as `{user email}+ses-weekly-newsletter-{i}@{user domain}`.
   - `{user-email}` is the portion up to the first `@` (0x40, dec 64). The `{user domain}` is everything after the first `@`.
2. For each email address created:
   1. Create a new contact with the provided email address in the `weekly-coupons-newsletter` contact list.
      - Operation: **CreateContact**
        - Parameters:
          - `ContactListName`: `weekly-coupons-newsletter`
          - `EmailAddress`: The email address provided by the user.
        - Errors:
          - `AlreadyExistsException`: If the contact already exists, skip this step for that contact and proceed with the next contact. This error can be safely ignored.
   2. Send a welcome email to the new contact using the content from the `welcome.html` file.
      - Operation: **SendEmail**
        - Parameters:
          - `FromEmailAddress`: Use the `verified_email` address provided in Prepare the Application.
          - `Destination.ToAddresses`: The generated email address variant.
          - `Content.Simple.Subject.Data`: "Welcome to the Weekly Coupons Newsletter"
          - `Content.Simple.Body.Text.Data`: Read the content from the `welcome.txt` file.
          - `Content.Simple.Body.Html.Data`: Read the content from the `welcome.html` file.
        - Errors:
          - See Errors in `SendEmail` for "Send the Coupon Newsletter"
   - Timing:
     - Because the account is likely in sandbox, wait 2 seconds between sending emails.

       - `ListManagementOptions`:
