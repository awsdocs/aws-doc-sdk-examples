# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. For more information, see the following GitHub documentation:
# https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners

# For example, in this file @rlhagerm owns any files in the /dotnetv3/
# directory and any of its subdirectories.
# Note that you will not be assigned as a reviewer if you are the
# author of the PR.
