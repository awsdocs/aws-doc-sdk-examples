# AWS IoT Fleetwise Service Scenario Specification

## Overview
This SDK Basics scenario demonstrates how to interact with AWS IoT Fleetwise using an AWS SDK. 
It demonstrates various tasks such as creating a Fleetwise catelog, creating an fleet, 
creating a vehicle, and so on.  Finally this scenario demonstrates how 
to clean up resources. Its purpose is to demonstrate how to get up and running with 
AWS Fleetwise SiteWise and an AWS SDK.

## Resources
This Basics scenario does not require any additional AWS resources. 

## Hello AWS Fleetwise SiteWise
This program is intended for users not familiar with the AWS IoT Fleetwise Service to easily get up and running. The program uses a `listSignalCatalogsPaginator` to demonstrate how you can read through catalog information.

## Basics Scenario Program Flow
The AWS IoT Fleetwise Basics scenario executes the following operations.

1. **Create an AWS FleetWise collection**:
   - Description: This step creates an AWS Fleetwise collection by invoking the `createSignalCatalog` method.
   - Exception Handling: Check to see if a `???` is thrown. 
     If it is thrown, display the asset model ID and move on.

2. **Create an IoT Fleetwise fleet**:
   - Description: This operation creates an AWS Fleetwise fleet.
   - The method `listSignalCatalogNodes` is called to retrieve a list of nodes.
   - Exception Handling: Check to see if a `???` is thrown. 

3. **Create a model manifest**:
   - Description: To create a model manifest, the method `listAssetModelProperties` is called. The node list is used to create the model manifest by calling `createModelManifest()`.
   - Exception Handling: Check to see if an `???` is thrown. If so, display the message and end the program.

4. **Create a decoder manifest**:
   - Description: This operation creates a decoder manifest.
   - This step uses the method `createDecoderManifest`.

5. **Check the status of the model manifest**:
   - Description: This operation checks the status of the model manifest.
   - This step uses the  `updateModelManifest`and `getModelManifest` methods.
   - Exception Handling: Check to see if a `???` is thrown. If so, display the message and end the program.

6. **Check the status of the decoder**:
   - Description: This operation creates an IoT Thing which is required to create a vehicle.
   - This step uses the  `createThing` method.
   - Exception Handling: Check to see if a `???` is thrown. If so, display the message and end the program.


7. **Create an IoT Thing**:
   - Description: This operation describes the portal and returns a URL for the portal.
   - The method `describePortal` is called and returns the URL.
   - Exception Handling: Check to see if a `ResourceNotFoundException` is thrown. If so, display the message and end the program.

8.  **Create a vehicle**:
   - Description: This operation creates a vehicle.
   - The method `createVehicle` is called.
   - Exception Handling: Check to see if an `???` is thrown. If so, display the message and end the program.

9. **Display vehicle details**:
   - Description: This operation describes the vehicle.
   - The method `getVehicle` is called.
   - Exception Handling: Check to see if a `???` is thrown. If so, display the message and end the program.

10. **Delete the AWS IoT SiteWise Assets**:
    - The `delete` methods are called to clean up the resources.
    - Exception Handling: Check to see if a `???` is thrown. If so, display the message and end the program."

### Program execution
The following shows the output of the AWS IoT Fleetwise Basics scenario in the console. 

```
 AWS IoT FleetWise is a managed service that simplifies the
 process of collecting, organizing, and transmitting vehicle
 data to the cloud in near real-time. Designed for automakers
 and fleet operators, it allows you to define vehicle models,
 specify the exact data you want to collect (such as engine
 temperature, speed, or battery status), and send this data to
 AWS for analysis. By using intelligent data collection
 techniques, IoT FleetWise reduces the volume of data
 transmitted by filtering and transforming it at the edge,
 helping to minimize bandwidth usage and costs.

At its core, AWS IoT FleetWise helps organizations build
scalable systems for vehicle data management and analytics,
supporting a wide variety of vehicles and sensor configurations.
You can define signal catalogs and decoder manifests that describe
how raw CAN bus signals are translated into readable data, making
the platform highly flexible and extensible. This allows
manufacturers to optimize vehicle performance, improve safety,
and reduce maintenance costs by gaining real-time visibility
into fleet operations.

2. Create a fleet that represents a group of vehicles
 Creating an IoT FleetWise fleet allows you to efficiently collect,
 organize, and transfer vehicle data to the cloud, enabling real-time
 insights into vehicle performance and health.

 It helps reduce data costs by allowing you to filter and prioritize
 only the most relevant vehicle signals, supporting advanced analytics
 and predictive maintenance use cases.

The fleet Id is fleetscott1

Enter 'c' followed by <ENTER> to continue:
c
Continuing with the program...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Create a model manifest
An AWS IoT FleetWise manifest defines the structure and
relationships of vehicle data. The model manifest specifies
which signals to collect and how they relate to vehicle systems,
while the decoder manifest defines how to decode raw vehicle data
into meaningful signals.


Enter 'c' followed by <ENTER> to continue:
c
Continuing with the program...

The manifest ARN is arn:aws:iotfleetwise:us-east-1:814548047983:model-manifest/manifestscott1

Enter 'c' followed by <ENTER> to continue:
c
Continuing with the program...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Create a decoder manifest
A decoder manifest in AWS IoT FleetWise defines how raw vehicle
data (such as CAN signals) should be interpreted and decoded
into meaningful signals. It acts as a translation layer
that maps vehicle-specific protocols to standardized data formats
using decoding rules. This is crucial for extracting usable
data from different vehicle models, even when their data
 formats vary.



Enter 'c' followed by <ENTER> to continue:
c
Continuing with the program...

The decoder manifest ARN is arn:aws:iotfleetwise:us-east-1:814548047983:decoder-manifest/decManifestscott1

Enter 'c' followed by <ENTER> to continue:
c
Continuing with the program...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Check the status of the model
 The model manifest must be in an ACTIVE state before it can be used
  to create or update a vehicle.


Enter 'c' followed by <ENTER> to continue:
c
Continuing with the program...

‚è±Ô∏è Elapsed: 5s | Status: ACTIVE ‚úÖ

Enter 'c' followed by <ENTER> to continue:

6. Check the status of the decoder
 The decoder manifest must be in an ACTIVE state before it can be used
  to create or update a vehicle.


Enter 'c' followed by <ENTER> to continue:
c
Continuing with the program...

‚è±Ô∏è Elapsed: 5s | Decoder Status: ACTIVE ‚úÖ

Enter 'c' followed by <ENTER> to continue:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Create an IoT Thing
AWS IoT FleetWise expects an existing AWS IoT Thing with the same
name as the vehicle name you are passing to createVehicle method.
Before calling createVehicle(), you must create an AWS IoT Thing
with the same name using the AWS IoT Core service.


Enter 'c' followed by <ENTER> to continue:
c
Continuing with the program...

‚úÖ IoT Thing created: vechile1

Enter 'c' followed by <ENTER> to continue:
c

8. Create a vehicle
Creating a vehicle in AWS IoT FleetWise allows you to digitally
represent and manage a physical vehicle within the AWS ecosystem.
This enables efficient ingestion, transformation, and transmission
of vehicle telemetry data to the cloud for analysis.


Enter 'c' followed by <ENTER> to continue:
c
Continuing with the program...

‚úÖ Vehicle 'vechile1' created successfully.
