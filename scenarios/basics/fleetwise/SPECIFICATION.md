### Program execution
The following shows the output of the AWS IoT Fleetwise Basics scenario. 

```
 AWS IoT FleetWise is a managed service that simplifies the
 process of collecting, organizing, and transmitting vehicle
 data to the cloud in near real-time. Designed for automakers
 and fleet operators, it allows you to define vehicle models,
 specify the exact data you want to collect (such as engine
 temperature, speed, or battery status), and send this data to
 AWS for analysis. By using intelligent data collection
 techniques, IoT FleetWise reduces the volume of data
 transmitted by filtering and transforming it at the edge,
 helping to minimize bandwidth usage and costs.

At its core, AWS IoT FleetWise helps organizations build
scalable systems for vehicle data management and analytics,
supporting a wide variety of vehicles and sensor configurations.
You can define signal catalogs and decoder manifests that describe
how raw CAN bus signals are translated into readable data, making
the platform highly flexible and extensible. This allows
manufacturers to optimize vehicle performance, improve safety,
and reduce maintenance costs by gaining real-time visibility
into fleet operations.

2. Create a fleet that represents a group of vehicles
Creating an IoT FleetWise fleet allows you to efficiently collect,
organize, and transfer vehicle data to the cloud, enabling real-time
insights into vehicle performance and health.

It helps reduce data costs by allowing you to filter and prioritize
only the most relevant vehicle signals, supporting advanced analytics
and predictive maintenance use cases.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Create a model manifest
An AWS IoT FleetWise manifest defines the structure and
relationships of vehicle data. The model manifest specifies
which signals to collect and how they relate to vehicle systems,
while the decoder manifest defines how to decode raw vehicle data
into meaningful signals.


Enter 'c' followed by <ENTER> to continue:
c
Continuing with the program...

The manifest ARN is arn:aws:iotfleetwise:us-east-1:814548047983:model-manifest/manifest60

c
Continuing with the program...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Create a decoder manifest
A decoder manifest in AWS IoT FleetWise defines how raw vehicle
data (such as CAN signals) should be interpreted and decoded
into meaningful signals. It acts as a translation layer
that maps vehicle-specific protocols to standardized data formats
using decoding rules. This is crucial for extracting usable
data from different vehicle models, even when their data
formats vary.



Enter 'c' followed by <ENTER> to continue:
c
Continuing with the program...

The decoder manifest ARN is arn:aws:iotfleetwise:us-east-1:814548047983:decoder-manifest/decManifest60
