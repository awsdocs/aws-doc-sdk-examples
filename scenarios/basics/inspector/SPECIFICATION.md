# Amazon Inspector Specification

This document contains a draft proposal for an *Amazon Inspector Basics Scenario*, generated by the Code Examples SpecGen AI tool. The specifications describe a potential code example scenario based on research, usage data, service information, and AI-assistance. The following should be reviewed for accuracy and correctness before proceeding on to a final specification.

## Proposed example structure

The output below demonstrates how this example would run for the customer. It includes a Hello service example (included for all services), and the scenario description. The scenario code would also be presented as Action snippets, with a code snippet for each SDK action.

### Hello

The Hello example is a separate runnable example. - Set up the Inspector service client - Check the current account status for Inspector - Display available scan types and regions

## Scenario

#### Setup

* Enable Amazon Inspector for the account
* Verify Inspector is successfully activated
* Display account status and enabled scan types

#### Coverage Assessment

* List coverage statistics for EC2 instances, ECR repositories, and Lambda functions
* Display resource coverage details
* Show scanning status for different resource types

#### Findings Management

* List security findings across all resource types
* Filter findings by severity level (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
* Retrieve detailed information for specific findings

#### Vulnerability Analysis

* Display vulnerability details including CVE information
* Show affected resources and remediation guidance
* Filter findings by resource type (EC2, ECR, Lambda)

#### Cleanup

* Optionally disable Inspector scanning (with user confirmation)
* Display final account status

## Errors

SDK Code examples include basic exception handling for each action used. The table below describes an appropriate exception which will be handled in the code for each service action.

|Action	|Error	|Handling	|
|---	|---	|---	|
|`Enable`	|ValidationException	|Validate resource types and account permissions.	|
|`Enable`	|AccessDeniedException	|Notify user of insufficient permissions and exit.	|
|`BatchGetAccountStatus`	|ValidationException	|Validate account IDs format.	|
|`BatchGetAccountStatus`	|AccessDeniedException	|Handle permission errors gracefully.	|
|`ListFindings`	|ValidationException	|Validate filter criteria and pagination parameters.	|
|`ListFindings`	|InternalServerException	|Retry operation with exponential backoff.	|
|`BatchGetFindingDetails`	|ValidationException	|Validate finding ARNs format.	|
|`BatchGetFindingDetails`	|AccessDeniedException	|Handle access denied for specific findings.	|
|`ListCoverage`	|ValidationException	|Validate filter and pagination parameters.	|
|`Disable`	|ValidationException	|Validate resource types for disabling.	|
|`Disable`	|ConflictException	|Handle cases where Inspector cannot be disabled.	|
