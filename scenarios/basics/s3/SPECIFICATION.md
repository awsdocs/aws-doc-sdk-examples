# Amazon S3 Batch Basics Scenario Specification

## Overview

This document outlines the technical specifications for the _Amazon S3 Batch Basic Scenario_, a scenario designed to demonstrate Amazon S3 Batch opertions functionality and SDKs. It is primarily intended for the AWS code examples team to use while developing this example in additional languages.


## Resources
The required resource is an IAM role that is automatically created using an AWS CloudFormation template.

## Scenario Program Flow
The Amazon S3 Batch basic scenario executes the following steps:

1. **Introduce Amazon S3 Batch**: The program provides a brief introduction to Amazon S3 Batch functionality.

2. **Create resources**: Uses Amazon CloudFormation to create the resources.

3. **Create Batch Job**: The program creates an S3 Batch job.

4. **Cancel the S3 Batch job**: The program cancels the S3 Batch job if the user requests that action.

5. **Describe the job**: The program describes the job that was just created. Details such as the status and the job priority are displayed.

6. **Describe the tags**: The program describes the tags associated with the job.

7. **Update Batch Job Tags**: The program adds additional tags to the job.

8. **List Batch Jobs**: The program lists all batch jobs under the account.

9. **Delete the Amazon S3 Batch job tagging**: The program deletes the job tagging.

10. **Delete the resources**: The program deletes the CloudFormation stack and the S3 bucket used in the scenario.


### Program execution
The following shows the output of the Amazon S3 Batch program in the console.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to the Amazon S3 Batch basics scenario.
S3 Batch is a powerful service provided by AWS that enables efficient and
cost-effective processing of large-scale data stored in Amazon S3.
It automatically scales resources to handle varying workloads without the need for manual
intervention.

One of the key features of S3 Batch is its ability to perform tagging operations on objects stored in
S3 buckets. Users can leverage S3 Batch to apply, update, or remove tags on thousands or millions of
objects in a single operation, streamlining the management and organization of their data.

This can be particularly useful for tasks such as cost allocation, lifecycle management, or
metadata-driven workflows, where consistent and accurate tagging is essential.
S3 Batch's scalability and serverless nature make it an ideal solution for organizations with
growing data volumes and complex data management requirements.

This Java program walks you through Amazon S3 Batch operations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Create a S3 Batch Job
This job tags all objects listed in the manifest file with tags

Enter 'c' followed by <ENTER> to continue:
c
Continuing with the program...

The Job id is 391171f8-d831-4931-a7eb-d56c43610e4b

Enter 'c' followed by <ENTER> to continue:
c
Continuing with the program...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Update an existing S3 Batch Operations job's priority
In this step, we modify the job priority value. The higher the number, the higher the priority.
So, a job with a priority of `30` would have a higher priority than a job with
a priority of `20`. This is a common way to represent the priority of a task
or job, with higher numbers indicating a higher priority.

Ensure that the job status allows for priority updates. Jobs in certain
states (e.g., Cancelled, Failed, or Completed) cannot have their priorities
updated. Only jobs in the Active or Suspended state typically allow priority
updates.

The job priority was updated

Enter 'c' followed by <ENTER> to continue:
c
Continuing with the program...
