# Specification for the AWS Entity Resolution Service Scenario

## Overview

This SDK Basics scenario demonstrates how to interact with AWS Entity Resolution
using an AWS SDK. It demonstrates various tasks such as creating a schema
mapping, creating an matching workflow, starting a workflow, and so on. Finally,
this scenario demonstrates how to clean up resources.

## Resources

This Basics scenario requires an IAM role that has permissions to work with the
AWS Entity Resolution service, an AWS Glue database and a table, and two S3
buckets.
A [CDK script](../../../resources/cdk/entityresolution_resources/README.md
) is provided to create these resources.

## Hello AWS Entity Resolution

This program is intended for users not familiar with the AWS Entity Resolution
Service to easily get up and running. The program uses a
`listMatchingWorkflowsPaginator` to demonstrate how you can read through
workflow information.

## Basics Scenario Program Flow

The AWS Entity Resolution Basics scenario executes the following operations.

1. **Create a schema mapping**:
    - Description: Creates a schema mapping by invoking the
      `createSchemaMapping` method.
    - Exception Handling: Check to see if a `ConflictException` is thrown, which
      indicates that the schema mapping already exists. If the exception is
      thrown, display the information and end the program.

2. **Create a Matching Workflow**:
    - Description: Creates a new matching workflow that defines how entities
      should be resolved and matched. The method `createMatchingWorkflow` is
      called.
    - Exception Handling: Check to see if a `ConflictException` is thrown, which
      is thrown if the matching workflow already exists. ALso check to see if a `ValidationException` is thrown. If so, display the message and end the program.

3. **Start Matching Workflow**:
    - Description: Initiates a matching workflow by calling the
      `startMatchingJob` method to process entity resolution based on predefined
      configurations.
    - Exception Handling: Check to see if an `ConflictException` is thrown,
      which indicates that the matching workflow job is already running. If the
      exception is thrown, display the message and end the program.

4. **Get Workflow Job Details**:
    - Description: Retrieves details about a specific matching workflow job by
      calling the `getMatchingJob` method.
    - Exception Handling: Check to see if an `ResourceNotFoundException` is
      thrown, which indicates that the workflow cannot be found. If the
      exception is thrown, display the message and end the program.

5. **Get Schema Mapping**:
    - Description: Returns the `SchemaMapping` of a given name by calling the
      `getSchemaMapping` method.
    - Exception Handling: Check to see if a `ResourceNotFoundException` is
      thrown. If so, display the message and end the program.

6. **List Matching Workflows**:
    - Description: Lists all matching workflows created within the account by
      calling the `listMatchingWorkflows` method.
    - Exception Handling: Check to see if an `CompletionException` is thrown. If
      so, display the message and end the program.

7. **Tag Resource**:
    - Description: Adds tags associated with an AWS Entity Resolution resource
      by calling the`tagResource` method.
    - Exception Handling: Check to see if a `ResourceNotFoundException` is
      thrown. If so, display the message and end the program
8. **View the results of the AWS Entity Resolution Workflow**:
    - Description: View the workflow results by calling the
      `getMatchingJob` method.
    - Exception Handling: Check to see if an `ResourceNotFoundException` is thrown. If
      so, display the message and end the program.

9. **Delete the AWS resources**:
    - Description: Delete the AWS resouces including the workflow and schema mappings by calling the
      `deleteMatchingWorkflow` and `deleteSchemaMapping` methods.
    - Exception Handling: Check to see if an `ResourceNotFoundException` is thrown. If
      so, display the message and end the program.   
    - Finally delete the CloudFormation Stack by calling these method:
       - CloudFormationHelper.emptyS3Bucket(glueBucketName);
       - CloudFormationHelper.destroyCloudFormationStack     

### Program execution

The following shows the output of the AWS Entity Resolution Basics scenario in
the console.

```
Welcome to the AWS Entity Resolution Scenario.
AWS Entity Resolution is a fully-managed machine learning service provided by
Amazon Web Services (AWS) that helps organizations extract, link, and
organize information from multiple data sources. It leverages natural
language processing and deep learning models to identify and resolve
entities, such as people, places, organizations, and products,
across structured and unstructured data.

With Entity Resolution, customers can build robust data integration
pipelines to combine and reconcile data from multiple systems, databases,
and documents. The service can handle ambiguous, incomplete, or conflicting
information, and provide a unified view of entities and their relationships.
This can be particularly valuable in applications such as customer 360,
fraud detection, supply chain management, and knowledge management, where
accurate entity identification is crucial.

The `EntityResolutionAsyncClient` interface in the AWS SDK for Java 2.x
provides a set of methods to programmatically interact with the AWS Entity
Resolution service. This allows developers to automate the entity extraction,
linking, and deduplication process as part of their data processing workflows.
With Entity Resolution, organizations can unlock the value of their data,
improve decision-making, and enhance customer experiences by having a reliable,
comprehensive view of their key entities.

To prepare the AWS resources needed for this scenario application, the next step uploads
a CloudFormation template whose resulting stack creates the following resources:
- An AWS Glue Data Catalog table
- An AWS IAM role
- An AWS S3 bucket
- An AWS Entity Resolution Schema

It can take a couple minutes for the Stack to finish creating the resources.

1. Create Schema Mapping
Entity Resolution schema mapping aligns and integrates data from
multiple sources by identifying and matching corresponding entities
like customers or products. It unifies schemas, resolves conflicts,
and uses machine learning to link related entities, enabling a
consolidated, accurate view for improved data quality and decision-making.

In this example, the schema mapping lines up with the fields in the JSON and CSV objects. That is,
it contains these fields: id, name, and email.

[jsonschema-ef86075e-cf5e-4bb1-be50-e0f19743ddb2] schema mapping Created Successfully!
The JSON schema mapping name is jsonschema-ef86075e-cf5e-4bb1-be50-e0f19743ddb2

2. Create an AWS Entity Resolution Workflow. 
An Entity Resolution matching workflow identifies and links records
across datasets that represent the same real-world entity, such as
customers or products. Using techniques like schema mapping,
data profiling, and machine learning algorithms,
it evaluates attributes like names or emails to detect duplicates
or relationships, even with variations or inconsistencies.
The workflow outputs consolidated, de-duplicated data.

We will use the machine learning-based matching technique.

8. View the results of the AWS Entity Resolution Workflow.
You cannot view the result of the workflow that is in a running state.
In order to view the results, you need to wait for the workflow that we started in step 3 to complete.

If you choose not to wait, you cannot view the results. You can perform
this task manually in the AWS Management Console.

This can take up to 30 mins (y/n).

Note that each of the last 3 pairs of records are considered a match even though the 'name' or 'email' differ between the records;
For example 'Bob Smith Jr.' compared to 'Bob Smith'.
The confidence level is a value between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a perfect match. In the last pair of matched records,
the confidence level is lower for the differing email addresses.

9. Do you want to delete the resources, including the workflow? (y/n)
You cannot delete the workflow that is in a running state.
In order to delete the workflow, you need to wait for the workflow to complete.

You can delete the workflow manually in the AWS Management Console at a later time.

If you already waited for the workflow to complete in the previous step,
the workflow is completed and you can delete it.

If the workflow is not completed, this can take up to 30 mins (y/n).
