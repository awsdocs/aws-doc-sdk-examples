# Create and run a SageMaker geospatial pipeline using an AWS SDK

## Overview

This example scenario demonstrates using AWS Lambda and Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) as part of an Amazon [SageMaker pipeline](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/pipelines.html). The pipeline itself executes a [geospatial job](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/geospatial-vej.html) to reverse geocode a sample set of coordinates into human-readable addresses. Input and output files are located in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket.

When you run the example console application, you can execute the following steps:

- Create the AWS resources and roles needed for the pipeline.
- Create the AWS Lambda function.
- Create the SageMaker pipeline.
- Upload an input file into an S3 bucket.
- Execute the pipeline and monitor its status.
- Display some output from the output file.
- Clean up the pipeline resources.

These steps are completed using AWS SDKs as part of an interactive demo that runs at a command prompt.
