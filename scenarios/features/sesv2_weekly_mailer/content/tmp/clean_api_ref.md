  Create a shell script that finds all files named 10_*.md in the current
  folder, and removes all content from the "See Also" line to the end of the file. The operation should work in place.
---

`sed -i _ '/See Also/,$d' 10_*.md`

This command does the following:

1. `sed` is the stream editor utility used to perform text transformations.
2. `'/^See Also/,$d'` is the sed command to delete lines. Specifically:
   - `^See Also` matches the line that starts with "See Also"
   - `,$` means "from the matched line to the end of the file"
   - `d` is the delete command
3. `10_*.md` is the pattern that matches all filenames starting with "10\_" and ending with ".md" in the current directory.
4. `>` redirects the output to a new file called `cleaned_files.md`.

So, this command will read all files matching the "10\_\*.md" pattern, remove everything from the "See Also" line to the end of each file, and write the cleaned content to a new file "cleaned_files.md".
