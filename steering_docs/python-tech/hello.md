# Python Hello Examples Generation

## MANDATORY: Knowledge Base Consultation (FIRST STEP)
**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL - Must be completed BEFORE any code generation**

```bash
# Step 1: List available knowledge bases
ListKnowledgeBases()

# Step 2: Query coding standards (REQUIRED)
QueryKnowledgeBases("coding-standards-KB", "Python-code-example-standards")

# Step 3: Query implementation patterns (REQUIRED)  
QueryKnowledgeBases("Python-premium-KB", "Python implementation patterns")

# Step 4: AWS service research (REQUIRED)
search_documentation("What is [AWS Service] and what are its key API operations?")
read_documentation("https://docs.aws.amazon.com/[service]/latest/[relevant-page]")
```

**FAILURE TO COMPLETE KNOWLEDGE BASE CONSULTATION WILL RESULT IN INCORRECT CODE STRUCTURE**

## Purpose
Generate simple "Hello" examples that demonstrate basic service connectivity and the most fundamental operation using direct boto3 client calls.

## Requirements
- **MANDATORY**: Every AWS service MUST include a "Hello" scenario
- **Simplicity**: Should be the most basic, minimal example possible
- **Standalone**: Must work independently of other examples
- **Direct Client**: Use boto3 client directly, no wrapper classes needed

## File Structure
```
python/example_code/{service}/
â”œâ”€â”€ {service}_hello.py          # Hello example file
```

## Hello Example Pattern

        response = {service}_client.{basic_operation}()

        if error_code == "UnauthorizedOperation":

        else:
            print(f"Couldn't access {AWS Service}. Error: {e}")

## Hello Examples by Service Type

### List-Based Services (S3, DynamoDB, etc.)
- **Operation**: List primary resources (buckets, tables, etc.)
- **Message**: Show count and names of resources

### Status-Based Services (GuardDuty, Config, etc.)  
- **Operation**: Check service status or list detectors/configurations
- **Message**: Show service availability and basic status

### Compute Services (EC2, Lambda, etc.)
- **Operation**: List instances/functions or describe regions
- **Message**: Show available resources or regions

## Validation Requirements
- âœ… **Must run without errors** (with proper credentials)
- âœ… **Must handle credential issues gracefully**
- âœ… **Must display meaningful output**
- âœ… **Must use direct boto3 client calls**
- âœ… **Must include proper snippet tags**

## Common Patterns
- Always use `boto3.client("{service}")` directly
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Provide user-friendly output messages
- Use appropriate logging levels
- Handle both service-specific and general errors
- Keep it as simple as possible - no additional classes or complexity
