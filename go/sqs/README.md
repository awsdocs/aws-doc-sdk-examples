# AWS SDK for Go code examples for Amazon SQS

## Purpose

These examples demonstrate how to perform various Amazon SQS operations.
For information about Amazon SQS,
see the
[Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide).

## Prerequisites

You must have an AWS account and have your default credentials and AWS Region
configured as described in
[Configuring the AWS SDK for Go](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/configuring-sdk.html)
in the *AWS SDK for Go Developer Guide*.

## Caveats

- You should grant these code examples least privilege,
  or at most the minimum  permissions required to perform the task.
  For more information, see
  [Grant Least Privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege)
  in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide.
- This code has not been tested in all Regions.
  Some AWS services are available only in specific
  [Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).
- Running the examples might result in charges to your AWS account.

## About the unit tests

The unit tests should delete any resources that they create.
However, they might result in charges to your
AWS account.

To run a unit test, enter the following:

`go test`

You should see something like the following,
where PATH is the path to folder containing the Go files.

```
PASS
ok      PATH 1.904s
```

If you want to see any log messages, enter:

`go test -test.v`

You should see some additional log messages.
The last two lines should be similar to the previous shown output.

## About the code examples

All of the code examples perform the operations in your default AWS Region
and use your default credentials.
See [Configuring the AWS SDK for Go](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/configuring-sdk.html) for details.

Each example is in its own directory, with a unit test.
Each example can be run on the command line, and most require at least one command-line argument.
To see the required command-line arguments, enter the following, where *FILENAME* is the name of the Go file.

`go run FILENAME`

The example displays an error message with information about the required command-line arguments.

### ChangeMsgVisibilty

This directory contains an example of changing the visibility of a message,
which prevents other consumers from processing the message.
For information about message visibility, see
[Amazon SQS Visibility Timeout](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html).

Use the following command to set the visibility of a message,
where:

- QUEUE is the name of the queue.
- MESSAGE-HANDLE is the receipt handle of the message.
  Get that value by using the **ReceiveMessages** example.
- VISIBILITY is how long, in seconds, the message is not available to other consumers.
  The example ensures that the value is between 0 and 43200 ( 12 hours).
  If omitted, it defaults to 30.

`go run ChangeMsgVisibility.go -q QUEUE -h MESSAGE-HANDLE [-v VISIBILITY]`

The unit test accepts the following configuration values in *config.json* and stores them in a struct:

- **Queue** is the name of the queue.
  The default is an empty string.
- **Visibility** is how long, in seconds, the message is not available to other consumers.
  The default is 30.
- **WaitTime** is the wait time, in seconds, the queue waits for the message to arrive.
  The default is 10.

The unit test:

1. Gets the values from *config.json* and stores them in a struct,
   ensuring that the **Visibility** value is between 0 and 43200 (12 hours)
   and the **WaitTime** value is between 0 (no long polling) and 20.
2. If the value of **Queue** is an empty string,
    it creates a queue with a random name starting with **myqueue-**.
3. If the value of **WaitTime** is greater than 0,
    it configures the queue for long polling with that value.
4. Sends a message to the queue.
5. Retrieves the message from the queue.
6. Sets the message visibility to the value of **Visibility**.
7. Deletes the message.
8. If it created the queue, it deletes the queue.

The unit test:

1. Gets the values from *config.json* and stores them in a struct,
   ensuring that the **WaitTime** value is between 1 and 20.
2. If the value of **Queue** is an empty string,
   it creates a queue with a random name starting with **mylpqueue-**.
3. Configures the queue for long polling with the value of **WaitTime**.
4. If it created the queue, it deletes the queue.
