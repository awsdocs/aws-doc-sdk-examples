# AWS SDK for Rust code example for [LocalStack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack)

## Purpose

This example demonstrate how to use LocalStack with the AWS SDK for Rust.

LocalStack is a cloud service emulator that runs in a single container on your computer.

## Code example

- [Get AWS resource information](src/bin/use-localstack.rs)

## âš  Important

- We recommend that you grant this code least privilege,
  or at most the minimum permissions required to perform the task.
  For more information, see
  [Grant Least Privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege)
  in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide.
- This code has not been tested in all AWS Regions.
  Some AWS services are available only in specific
  [Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).
- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.
