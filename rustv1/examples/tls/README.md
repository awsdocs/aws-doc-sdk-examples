# AWS SDK for Rust code examples for TLS

## Purpose

These examples demonstrate how to adjust TLS settings to custom values.
This can help you enforce custom levels of security.
For example, you might require a minimum version of TLS 1.3 for outgoing calls.

## Code examples

### Scenario examples

* [Setting the minimum TLS version to 1.3](src/lib.rs)

### API examples

## âš  Important

- We recommend that you grant this code least privilege,
  or at most the minimum permissions required to perform the task.
  For more information, see
  [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege)
  in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide.
- This code has not been tested in all AWS Regions.
  Some AWS services are available only in specific
  [Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).
- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.

### Prerequisites

You must have an AWS account with your default credentials and AWS Region properly configured.
For more information, see the
[Getting Started](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust#getting-started-with-the-sdk)
section of the SDK for Rust README.
The minimum version of Rust that's needed to run the SDK is listed
[here](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust#supported-rust-versions-msrv).
Instructions for installing Rust and Cargo can be found in the
[official Rust documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html).

## Running the code examples

### Setting the minimum TLS version to 1.3

Shows how to use rustls to build a custom connector and pass it to the client to make calls.
This example uses AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) for demonstration purposes,
but you can extrapolate this for use with any service that supports TLS 1.3.
To start, run the following at a command prompt from the Rust root of the project:

```
cargo run --bin tls
```

Or, to run the test suite, run the following command from the Rust root of the project:

```
cargo test -p tls --test test-tls -- --include-ignored
```

We prefer to create code examples that show broad scenarios rather than individual API calls.
