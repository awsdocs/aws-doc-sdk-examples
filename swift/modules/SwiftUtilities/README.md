# SwiftUtilities

The _SwiftUtilities_ package provides various tools and utility functions
that are useful in sample code and in tests for those examples.

The included utility functions are as follows:

## String

The `String` class is extended with the following functions:

### `uniqueName(withPrefix:withExtension:isValid) -> String`

Generates a guaranteed-unique name which can be used for anything from unique
strings in an array to names for files, S3 buckets, data objects, or any
other named object.

#### Parameters

* `withPrefix`: A string used at the beginning of the specified name. By
  default, no prefix is applied.

* `withExtension`: A string specifying an extension to add to the end of the
  name, for file names. Do not include the period (".") in the string; it is
  added for you. By default, no extension is added.

* `isValid`: A Boolean indicating whether or not the generated name should be a
  valid one. For the purposes of this function, it is assumed that a valid name
  cannot start with a comma (","), and should not include either numbers or the
  percent ("%") symbol. Between these, the resulting string is usually not valid for most use cases. By default, this is `false`, which causes a valid
  name to be returned.

### Return value

A `String` containing the generated unique name. The name is a UUID,
although it might be altered based on the provided options.

### `withLoremText(paragraphs:) -> String`

Returns a Lorem Ipsum-style string containing the specified number of randomly
generated paragraphs. If `paragraphs` is not specified, then five paragraphs of
Lorem Ipsum text are returned. Each paragraph is four to eight sentences long,
and each sentence contains three to nine words.

The Lorem Ipsum text is suitable for use in test files and example strings
because it doesn't need translation and it doesn't unnecessarily make test code
larger than necessary.

#### Parameters

* `paragraphs`: The number of paragraphs to generate. If not specified, the
  resulting string contains five paragraphs.

#### Return value

A `String` containing up to `paragraphs` paragraphs of Lorem Ipsum-style
generated text.

## Testing

This package includes automated tests for each function. Before you run the
tests, make sure you configure your environment to allow access to AWS and
[download and install](https://www.swift.org/download/) the Swift tools if you don't already have them.

To run the tests, make sure you have Swift installed, then issue the command
`swift test` to run the tests.

```
$ cd SwiftUtilities
$ swift test
```

The tests will compile and run, outputting the results to the console. You can
also run the tests in Xcode if you prefer.
