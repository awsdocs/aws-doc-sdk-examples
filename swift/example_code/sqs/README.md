# Amazon SQS code examples for the SDK for Swift

## Overview

Shows how to use the AWS SDK for Swift to work with Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS).

<!--custom.overview.start-->
<!--custom.overview.end-->

_Amazon SQS is a fully managed message queuing service that makes it easy to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications._

## ⚠ Important

* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account. For more details, see [AWS Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) and [Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/).
* Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.
* We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege).
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

### Single actions

Code excerpts that show you how to call individual service functions.

- [CreateQueue](CreateQueue/Sources/entry.swift#L29)
- [DeleteMessageBatch](DeleteMessageBatch/Sources/entry.swift#L31)
- [DeleteQueue](DeleteQueue/Sources/entry.swift#L29)
- [GetQueueAttributes](GetQueueAttributes/Sources/entry.swift#L29)
- [ListQueues](basics/Sources/entry.swift#L30)
- [ReceiveMessage](ReceiveMessage/Sources/entry.swift#L31)
- [SetQueueAttributes](SetQueueAttributes/Sources/entry.swift#L32)

### Scenarios

Code examples that show you how to accomplish a specific task by calling multiple
functions within the same service.

## Run the examples

### Instructions

To build any of these examples from a terminal window, navigate into its
directory, then use the following command:

```
$ swift build
```

To build one of these examples in Xcode, navigate to the example's directory
(such as the `ListUsers` directory, to build that example). Then type `xed.`
to open the example directory in Xcode. You can then use standard Xcode build
and run commands.

#### Hello Amazon SQS

This example shows you how to get started using Amazon SQS.



#### Publish messages to queues

This example shows you how to do the following:

- Create topic (FIFO or non-FIFO).
- Subscribe several queues to the topic with an option to apply a filter.
- Publish messages to the topic.
- Poll the queues for messages received.
