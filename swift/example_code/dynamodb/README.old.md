## ⚠ Important

* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account. For more details, see [AWS Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) and [Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/).
* Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.
* We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege).
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

## Run the examples

### Instructions

To build any of these examples from a terminal window, navigate into its
directory, then use the following command:

```
$ swift build
```

To build one of these examples in Xcode, navigate to the example's directory
(such as the `ListUsers` directory, to build that example). Then type `xed.`
to open the example directory in Xcode. You can then use standard Xcode build
and run commands.

#### Learn the basics

This example shows you how to do the following:

- Create a table that can hold movie data.
- Put, get, and update a single movie in the table.
- Write movie data to the table from a sample JSON file.
- Query for movies that were released in a given year.
- Scan for movies that were released in a range of years.
- Delete a movie from the table, then delete the table.
