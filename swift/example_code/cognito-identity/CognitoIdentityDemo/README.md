# CognitoIdentityDemo

In this, the first example introduced in the _AWS SDK for Swift Developer's Guide_, we create a simple command-line program that uses your default AWS account, as configured using the AWS CLI or otherwise, to simply create a new Cognito Identity Pool, or to return the ID of the existing one if one's already present.

## Prerequisites

* Swift 5.5 or later

## Building the example

To build this example, use the command:

``
$ swift build
```
