# AWS Security Token Service  code examples for the SDK for C++
## Overview
Shows how to use the AWS C++ SDK to access the AWS Security Token
Service (AWS STS) to acquire temporary credentials that grant specific permissions.

*AWS provides AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) as a web service that enables you to request temporary, limited-privilege credentials for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users or for users you authenticate (federated users).*
## ⚠️ Important
* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account. 
* Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.
* We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege). 
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).
## Code examples

### Single actions
Code excerpts that show you how to call individual service functions.
- [Assume a role](./assume_role.cpp) (AssumeRole)
## Run the examples

### Prerequisites
Before using the code examples, first complete the installation and setup steps
of [Getting Started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-cpp/v1/developer-guide/getting-started.html) in the AWS SDK for
C++ Developer Guide.
This section covers how to get and build the SDK, and how to build your own code by using the SDK with a
sample Hello World-style application.

Next, for information on code examples structures and how to build and run the examples, see [Getting started with the AWS SDK for C++ code examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-cpp/v1/developer-guide/getting-started-code-examples.html).

## Tests
⚠️ Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.
