# Feedback Sentiment Analyzer (FSA)

Feedback Sentiment Analyzer (FSA) is an example application that showcases AWS services and SDKs. Built with ❤️ for you to explore, download, and deploy.

## What it does

Specifically, this application solves a fictitious use case of a hotel in New York City that receives guest feedback on comment cards in a variety of languages.

These comment cards are uploaded through a web client, transformed using a suite of machine learning services, and rendered through the same web client. The end result contains the original image, an English translation of the text, and an audio element.

   export FSA_LANG=ruby
   ```

   _Windows cmd_

   ```
   set FSA_NAME=ana
   set FSA_EMAIL=ana@example.com
   set FSA_LANG=ruby
   ```

   _Windows Powershell_

   ```
   $Env:FSA_NAME = ana
   $Env:FSA_EMAIL = ana@example.com
   $Env:FSA_LANG = ruby
   ```
